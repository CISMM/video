2009-11-19  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : Changed the comparison for lost trackers
		so that it checks for <= the threshold so that in regions of
		the image with identically zero values lost trackers will still
		be detected.  Makes the program play and quit at the end when
		we're auto-finding beads at program start-up and when we start
		with no GUI.  This prevents batch versions of the program from
		hanging forever.

2009-10-11  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* base_camera_server.vcproj : Adding generic raw video file reader.
	* controllable_video.h : Replacing Pulnix_Raw with generic Raw
		controllable video.  Adding parameters to make the raw server
		able to open images of arbitrary resolution.
	* edt_server.cpp : Making EDT_Pulnix server derive from new
		generic raw reader.
	* edt_server.h : same.
	* raw_file_server.cpp : New reader for generic raw video files.
		Includes the ability to skip headers for the file and for
		each frame.  Includes parameters (but not implementation)
		for arbitrary bit depth and more than one channel.
	* raw_file_server.h : same.
	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : Can now load raw video files with
		arbitrary resolution.  Tries the Pulnix and Point Grey
		resolutions and opens them automatically.  Otherwise
		throws a dialog box asking for the resolution.
	* video_spot_tracker.tcl : same.
	* cismm_video_optimizer.vjcproj : Having it put the manifest back
		in the file now that we've solved the DLL problem.
	* video_spot_tracker.vcproj : same.

2009-10-07  Ryan Schubert <res@cs.unc.edu>

	* video_z_tracker.vcproj : Manually added necessary wx libs.  These
		used to be pragma comment'd in by a redirecting wx header
		that will no longer be used in the next version of the buildtime.
		This will still build with the old version of the buildtime as
		well.

2009-10-07  Ryan Schubert <res@cs.unc.edu>

	* point_grey_library.vcproj : Added PGRCam.* to project.
	* point_grey_server.* : Filled in all stubs except for
		write_to_opengl_texture().
	* video_imager_server.* : Added support for point grey cameras.
		Specified by "pgr" these currently can take a framerate
		and an exposure (shutter) time.
	* PGRCam.* : Added wrapper class for Point Grey cameras.

2009-09-26  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* Makefile : Making it compile on BASS using system ImageMagick.

2009-09-26  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* spot_tracker.cpp : Defining min() so it compiles under Linux.
	* Makefile : Making it compile on Linux (BASS).

2009-09-24  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* cismm_vide_optimizer.vcproj : Pulled the manifest out of the program
		so that we can hand-edit a correct one to ship with the program
		that doesn't try to load two different copies of MSVCRT.

2009-09-23  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* video_imager_server.proj : Pulled the manifest out of the
		program so that we can hand-edit a correct one to ship with
		the program that doesn't try to load two different copies
		of MSVCRT.
	* video_imager_server.proj : Same.
	* video_imager_server.cpp : Changed the version number.
	* video_imager_server.cpp : Same.

2009-08-20  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* video_imager_server.cpp : Changed to version 03.07 so we could build a
		new installer that includes the MSVCRT manifest and other DLL files
		needed to run the program.  This works on most machines, but still
		has trouble on cuprum (where video spot tracker's newest version
		also has problems), probably due to an incompatible DLL from a
		camera driver.

2009-08-12  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* VRPN_Imager_camera_server.cpp : Changed it so that it either copies the
		previous frame (by default) or a blank frame into the buffer to be
		filled in.  This enables reading in of frames that are only partially
		filled by the server without visual distractions.
	* VPRN_Imager_camera_server.h : Same.
	* controllable_video.h : Sets the VRPN Imager camera to use 16 bits, which
		it always does.
	* cismm_video_optimizer.cpp : New release with the other changes built in.
	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : Links to all of the changes above.  New version
		that includes all of them.

2009-08-10  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* mcl.cfg : Inverted the direction of travel for the MCL stage; they
		are mounted so that +Z is down on our instruments.  This had to
		be inverted both on the way out (Poser) and the way in (Tracker).
		Made a new installer for version 2.08 with that and with some
		improved shortcuts.

2009-08-08  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : Moved display of targets in front of path trace.
		Moved VRPN client-side logging into a separate thread so that it
		can pull the video data out of the server and keep the application
		from locking up.
	* cismm_video_optimizer.vcproj : Making it compile with the latest version
		of NSRG buildtime.
	* cismm_video_optimizer.cpp : Added comments asking and responding to why
		it has trouble reading from VST-generated logfiles.

2009-08-03  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : Added option to forward video on the logging
		connection; it sends only one full frame out of 300 but sends
		a small subset of the data around each tracker each frame.  This
		should let us radically shrink the size of video files, and should
		also let us forward video through spot tracker to another app,
		thus reducing the bandwidth leaving the video server. *** Warning ***
		This still has a bug: it will lock up if you actually try to log
		the video because the client never calls mainloop() to read in
		the messages.  This needs to be pulled out into another thread.
		But it does let you forward the video to a remote server.
	* video_spot_tracker.tcl : Same.

2009-07-31  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : Added buttons to save and load the state of the
		program, along with a -load_state comand-line option.  Updates version
		number to 5.29.

2009-07-31  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* video_imager_server.cpp : Adds a command-line option to only send one out of
		every Nth frame.  This lets us reduce the frame rate (and storage
		required) when we don't need all of the frames.
	* directx_camera_server.cpp : Removed timing printf().

2009-07-31  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : Has a "-nogui" option that turns off the GLUT
		display window, which should remove our limitation of only tracking
		up to the video-display frame rate.

2009-07-28  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* edt_server.cpp : Slight changes, mostly in comments, done
		while debugging for a new release using he old server.
	* vrpn_imager_server.vcproj : New release (3.05) that uses the
		old EDT library that doesn't have high latency.

2009-07-27  Ryan Schubert <res@cs.unc.edu>

	* video_imager_server.vcproj : Adding cooke pco library
		include path (couldn't find SC2_Cam.lib).

2009-07-27  Ryan Schubert <res@cs.unc.edu>

	* point_grey_library.* : Added PGR camera library project 
		(just header; empty cpp file).
	* video.sln : Added point_grey_library project.

2009-06-17  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : Released version 5.28.

2009-06-26  Ryan Schubert <res@cs.unc.edu>

	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : Added a missing newline in usage.

2009-06-25  Ryan Schubert <res@cs.unc.edu>

	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : Added intensity-based new lost
		sensitvity functionality into the command-line options.

2009-06-17  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* base_camera_server.cpp : Took out overly-restrictive test on
		the boundaries for the image boundaries in a double_image
		object.
	* spot_tracker.cpp : Changed the cone tracker back to doing
		only positive weightings (not weighting the surround
		negatively and the center positively) to make it work
		right.  Also changed it to only go to the radius you
		ask for rather than twice the radius.
	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : Adding intensity-based lost-tracker
		threshold based on how much the tracker pixel varies from
		the background.

2009-06-16  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : Avoids changing the size of the
		newly-active tracker when a tracker is deleted when
		they are a different size.  Increases the search
		radius for "follow jumps" to be four times the bead
		radius so that it will follow larger jumps.
	* spot_tracker.cpp : For the image-based spot tracker, when
		it is grabbing an image it will reduce the radius if
		needed to avoid grabbing pixels outside of the image,
		rather than just giving up if it was asked to grab
		pixels outside the image.  Modified twlines_image
		tracker to return highly negative fitness when its
		center goes outside the image.  Same for image tracker.
		Never divides by zero on the symmetric kernel to avoid
		fitness becoming NaN.

2009-06-16  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* file_list.cpp : Added space to the descriptur string so that
		it does not overflow.

2009-02-19  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : Switched from abs() to fabs() for numbers
		that were doubles during SMD calculation.

2008-01-26  Ryan Schubert  <res@cs.unc.edu>

	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : Changed the code that cleared up the
		tracker list memory on program exit to properly free up
		all memory.  Fixed a bug that the new destructor introduced
		where when the active tracker was deleted, its xy and z
		trackers were being deleted manually but not sell to NULL.
		This was changed to just rely on the destructor to delete the
		xy and z trackers (but could have been changed to set the
		pointers to NULL after deleting them explicitly as well).

2008-01-26  Ryan Schubert  <res@cs.unc.edu>

	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : Removing two debug printfs that I missed
		before my previous commit.

2008-01-26  Ryan Schubert  <res@cs.unc.edu>

	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : Wrote a destructor for the
		Spot_Information class, and a helper function which utilizes
		this to clear up a std::list of Spot_Information pointers.
		This wasn't necessary anymore (Russ already fixed the memory
		leak issues), but seems like a safer way of cleaning up this
		memory.

2009-01-23  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* spot_tracker.h : Made the base-class destructor virtual, which is
		needed to make things work correctly when deleting derived
		types.  This fixed a memory leak with the symmetric kernel.
	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : White space clean-up.  New version number
		(5.25).  Made installer.

2009-01-23  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : Switched from delete to delete [] for memory
		that was allocated with new [].  This didn't fix the memory leak,
		but will save us from trouble later.

2009-01-22  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : Removed the upper limit on the number of
		trackable spots (turned it into a vector, now that VRPN can
		handle arbitrary sensor numbers).

2008-12-18  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* stack_collector.cpp : Changed so that you can't select 8-bit
		saving, which is currently broken.  Version 2.07.
	* stack_collector.vcproj : Changed so that it compiles with the
		NSRG Buildtime 3.0 and installs without the need for an
		NSRG Runtime.  Version 2.07 installer.

2008-12-10  Ryan Schubert  <res@cs.unc.edu>

	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : Added Radius to the command line
		parameters that can be passed in.

2008-12-08  Ryan Schubert  <res@cs.unc.edu>

	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : Added a slider in the
		lost_and_found window for controlling the global SMD
		local neighborhood raius (over which we look for the
		max SMD value to determine our candidate scanlines).
		Added command line parameter support for all controls
		in the lost_and_found window, and updated the usage
		for new switchs and for lengths.

2008-10-26  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : Added a "dead zone" around the
		edge of the screen, where trackers get lost if they
		go there.  Alsoo added one around each tracker, to
		avoid having trackers overlap each other.
		Updated version number.  Made installer.

2008-10-25  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* video_spot_tracker.vcproj : Changed to not include both the
		debug and release versions of the ImageMagick library.
		Only includes release now.  This made the program run on
		a machine without Visual Studio installed.

2008-10-17  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : Updated version number.  Made
		installer.

2008-09-19  Ryan Schubert  <res@cs.unc.edu>

	* video_z_tracker.vcproj : Fixed the external libraries
		absolute paths to work with the new buildtime.

2008-09-19  Ryan Schubert  <res@cs.unc.edu>

	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : Reverted "for each" statements to
		general "for" statements.

2008-09-15  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* edt_library.vcproj : Makes it compile using the version of
		the library in the NSRG Buildtime 3.0.
	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : Compiles without warnings (but will
		currently only work in Visual Studio compiler due to
		"for each" language).
	* video_spot_tracker.vcproj : Compiles and links with NSRG
		Buildtime 3.0 (lots of linker warnings for no debug info in
		debug mode).  Requires some DLLs from OpenCV to run, so
		need to change the installer to add these (can we
		statically link this?)

2008-09-15  David Marshburn  <marshbur@cs.unc.edu>

	* diaginc_library.vcproj:  corrected paths for new buildtime.
	also, for some reason, it was necessary to define _WINDOWS to
	the c/c++ preprocessor for the spot library to correctly define
	all the stuff that it needed to define.
	* diaginc_server.cpp:  the SPOT library did away with the 
	SPOT_INTF_CARD_STRUCT structure and the SpotFindInterfaceCards 
	function in favor of the SPOT_DEVICE_STRUCT structure and the
	SpotFindDevices function.  it seems to have been a simple name
	change; at least, everything compiles if i just swap in the 
	new names.
	* roper_library.vcproj:  corrected paths for new buildtime.

2008-09-15  Ryan Schubert  <res@cs.unc.edu>

	* video_z_tracker.vcproj : Updating for the new buildtime.

2008-09-15  Ryan Schubert  <res@cs.unc.edu>

	* *.vcproj : Updating project files for the new buildtime.

2008-09-11  David Marshburn  <marshbur@cs.unc.edu>

	* *.vcproj:  updated paths for new build/run-time.  these are
	only the projects used by nano; others surely need to be 
	updated.

2008-08-21  David Marshburn  <marshbur@cs.unc.edu>

	* video.sln:  added some dependencies where needed.  added
	quatlib to the list of projects (needed by z tracker)
	* roper_library.vcproj:  added the buildtime include/lib dirs
	* video_z_tracker.vcproj:  added the buildtime include/lib dirs
	
2008-08-19  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

	* spot_tracker.h,.C: Added methods to spot_tracker_XY to set desired
	radius accuracy, sample separation, and inversion. Added local maximum
	spot tracker.

2008-04-28  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* controllable_video.h : Changing the bit depth of the Roper cameras
		to 16 bits.  This matches the present cameras we have.
	* roper_server.cpp : Various changes to get this to work, mostly
		dealing with changing the bit depth from 12 to 16.  Also
		changed the way things are set up in memory for the new version
		of the Roper code.  Also tried to make it exit without
		hanging; it happens less frequently now and also in a slightly
		better state, but it still happens.
	* roper_server.h : Same.

2008-04-19  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* base_camera_server.cpp : Added a new double_image class that
		stores an image in doubles and lets you write to the
		pixels.  Changed several other classes (disc, cone, Gaussian)
		to derive from this base class.
	* base_camera_server.h : Same.
	* image_wrapper.cpp : Same.
	* image_wrapper.h : Same.
	* spot_tracker.cpp : Changed the cone kernel to penalize (-1 weight)
		bright areas outside of the center, rather than just weighting
		them at zero.
	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : Added automatic tracker initialization
		to keep a certain number of active beads in the image.  This
		works well with disc and cone kernels, but tends to find
		flat spots with the symmetric kernel despite putting in a
		second step to the algorithm.  Version 5.21.

2008-04-14  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* roper_server.cpp : Makes it open the last available camera rather than
		the first, which works better on one of our setups.
	* stack_collector.cpp : Fixed an array-size allocation error.  Makes
		the camera and stage not fake by default.  Updates to work with
		to most recent VRPN.
	* file_stack_library.vcproj : White space changes.

2008-04-04  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* roper_server.cpp : Switched to not shifting left the bytes, which
		were wrapping.  Version 03_04.

2008-04-03  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* roper_server.cpp : Switched it back... the code was right
		but there was a bug in VRPN.  Version 03_03.

2008-04-02  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* roper_server.cpp : Switched which byte gets sent from the
		Roper camera; it seems to have been sending the lower-
		order byte, based on the fact that it wrapped around
		in Ryan's code.

2008-03-13  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* average_videos.dsp : Making it compile under VS6.0 and/or
		VS 2005.  Or at least come closer.
	* make_test_image.cpp : Same.
	* roper_example.vcproj : Same.
	* roper_spot_tracker.cpp : Same.
	* roper_spot_tracker.vcproj : Same.
	* swap_ppm_lines.cpp : Same.
	* video.sln : Same.
	* video_imager_server.cpp : Same.

2008-03-13  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : Fixed the bug the right way so it
		would not miss deleting any beads that have gotten
		lost; due to the increment of the loop counter in all
		cases in the previous version, it could miss one for
		every deleted one.  Version 5.20.

2008-03-12  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : Fixed crash bug when the last tracker is
		autodeleted by "lost and found".  Version 5.19.

2008-03-05  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* edt_server.cpp : Puts in a time estimate that isn't broken
		but isn't completely accurate.
	* video_imager_server.ccp : Updated version to 3.01.

2008-02-20  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : Added a calculation and storage of the
		summed value above background for FIONA kernels.

2008-02-19  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* VRPN_Imager_camera_server.cpp : Comment changes.
	* edt_server.cpp : Same.
	* video_imager_server.cpp : Same.

2008-02-13  David Marshburn  <marshbur@cs.unc.edu>

	* .cvsignore:  tells cvs to ignore several types of
	automatically generated files.

2008-01-25  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* video_imager_server.cpp : Adds a command-line option to tell
		how many camera buffers to use.  Currently only implemented
		on the EDT camera.

2008-01-09  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* video_imager_server.cpp : Version 3.0.  Runs a separate thread
		for a video imager server on a local loopback (port 9999).
		In the main thread, it runs an imager forwarder on port 3883
		so that clients can connect and preview as well as request
		full-rate logging.

2007-12-29  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : Version 5.17.  Records the background and
		summed value for FIONA trackers in the CSV log file.
	* spot_tracker.h : Added accessor methods for background and
		summed value for FIONA trackers.

2007-12-03  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* image_wrapper.h : Whitespace changes.
	* spot_math.h : Corrected step size in Gaussian integrator.
		Comment changes.
	* spot_tracker.cpp : Changed the FIONA tracker's error
		calculation routine to not be averse to switching between
		pixels.  The old version hopped from one row to the next
		all at once, pulling in a whole new set of pixels.  This
		version interpolates the weighting from the edge pixels
		along each direction, so that there is not a sudden change
		going from pixel to pixel.  This fixes a bug pointed out
		by Yuval Ebenstein where the FIONA tracker favored moving
		along the pixel boundaries.
	* spot_tracker.h : Whitespace changes.
	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : Version 5.16.

2007-11-30  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* roper_server.cpp : Fixed a type-cast problem where unsigned chars
		were being converted into ints rather than the pointers being
		converted into pointers to ints.

2007-11-13  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* video_imager_server.cpp : New version of video_imager_server built with the latest VRPN.

2007-10-28  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* airy_maker.cpp : Puts out a format for its log files that is
		compatible with the spot-tracker testing scripts.  Made
		version 1.07 with the changes.

2007-10-28  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : Fixed a bug that caused it to crash when
		a FIONA kernel was created at the command line.  Also added
		a command-line parameter to set the default FIONA background
		level.  Changed version number to 5.15.  Made installer.

2007-10-21  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* video_spot_tracker.tcl : Changed the interface to group the lost-
		tracker handling into a separate dialog box, and made the
		boolean delete/hover into a radiobutton set so you can only
		choose one.
	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : Same.
	* Version number change to 5.14 for new release.

2007-10-21  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : Fixed a bug in the lost-tracking code
		that had been inserted when I added the "autodelete" function.
		It is now possible for trackers to get un-lost without getting
		deleted.  Added a "hover when lost" option that is supposed to
		help keep FIONA kernels on blinking dots.  It does not log during
		frames where the trackers are lost, but lets them pick up and
		get un-lost later.
	* spot_tracker.cpp : Made the FIONA kernel invertible, and made sure
		that it never goes negative if it is not inverted (and never
		positive if it is) to prevent getting stuck on the wrong side
		of zero.  Changed the optimization for the FIONA kernel to not
		try and move if it has no signal (zero summedarea).

2007-10-19  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* VRPN_Imager_library.dsp : Project to include this in the Visual
		Studio 6 build.  We can't use the VS 2005 build until we
		figure out the manifest mangling that has to happen.
	* directx_camera_server.cpp : Improved error message.  Made it not
		crash when it fails to open a camera.
	* video.dsw : Added project.
	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : Incremented version number.

2007-10-15  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* controllable_video.h : Enable loading of PNG files with the
		file stack loader.
	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : Canceling the "Logging" dialog now
		clears the logging checkbox.  Cancelling the "Optimize in Z"
		dialog no longer crashes the program.  Added button to enable
		not logging bead positions when optimization is not on, so
		that people can skip frames where a single-fluorophore bead
		has blinked off.
	* file_list.cpp : Uses correct printf string description when making
		file names (the old one only worked on Windows).

2007-09-14  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* edt_server.cpp : Modified so that it not only reports frames
		lost due to bus contention but also possibly-lost frames
		when all memory buffers fill up.
	* edt_server.h : Same.
	* video_imager_server.cpp : Made the default number of memory
		buffers be 360 frames (so we can run 3 seconds behind)
		to reduce the dropped frames during connect/drop handling
		and to avoid losing frames to slow disk.

2007-09-12  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* SEM_camera_server.h : Changed function to non-const so that it
		can report skipped frames.
	* SEM_camera_server.cpp : Same.
	* VRPN_Imager_camera_server.h : same.
	* VRPN_Imager_camera_server.cpp : same.

	* roper_server.cpp : same.
	* video_imager_server.cpp : Adds error report if can't send a frame.
		Asks for 10 buffers from EDT.

2007-09-02  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* SEM_camera_server.h : Enabling multiple inclusion.

	* edt_server.h : same.
	* file_stack_server.h : same.
	* roper_server.h : same.
	* VRPN_Imager_camera_server.cpp : Comment.
	* controllable_video.h : Groups common camera-opening code from
		VST, video optimizer, and average_videos into one file that
		everyone can use to avoid code duplication.
	* average_videos.cpp : Includes common camera-opening code.
	* cismm_video_optimizer.cpp : same.
	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : same.
	* average_video.vcproj : Debug version compiles (something wrong
		with release still).

2007-09-01  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* VRPN_Imager_camera_server.cpp : Adds a camera that can look at
		either a live vrpn_Imager feed or a stored vrpn_Imager file.
		Does not properly handle color images (just writes whichever
		region came last into the buffer).  Does handle transcoding
		from 8-bit to 16-bit images.  Does double-buffer to prevent
		partial updates.
	* VRPN_Imager_camera_server.h : Same.
	* vrpn_Imager_library.vcproj: Adds library to build it.
	* video.sln : Adds library to the project.
	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : Adds ability to specify an imager
		device or an imager device in a file (assumes Imager0)
		and track from a vrpn_Imager.

2007-07-31  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* video_z_tracker.vcproj : Removed file that is not needed (and no
		longer exists).  Points to the correct version of a library
		file in Debug mode.  Now compiles and runs in VC 2005.

2007-07-31  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* GUItake.vcproj : Settings to make all of the programs
		compile (or come closer to compiling) under VS 2005.
		Some projects had to have msvcrt.dll explicitly
		removed from their Debug links (dunno why, but the
		ones that worked already had this).  Some have new
		include or link paths.
	* add_noise_to_image.cpp : Same.
	* add_noise_to_image.vcproj : Same.
	* average_videos.vcproj : Same.
	* compare_tracking_file.vcproj : Same.

	* video.sln : Same.

2007-07-30  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* average_videos.vcproj : Making things compile with VC 2005
		and the new version 2.0 of the NSRG buildtime.

	* cismm_video_optimizer.vcproj : Same.
	* stack_collector.cpp : Same.
	* stack_collector.vcproj : Same.
	* video.sln : Same.

2007-07-30  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* average_videos.cpp : Compiles on Visual Studio 5.0 and
		on version 6.  Moved all _LIB definitions into the files
		and out of the projects to make them explicit.
	* average_videos.vcproj : Same.
	* base_camera_server.dsp : Same.
	* file_stack_library.dsp : Same.
	* video.sln : Same.

	* video_spot_tracker.vcproj : Same.

2007-07-29  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* add_noise_to_image.cpp : Moving the "_LIB" definition into
		all of the locations that include magick/api.h to let
		us link statically without defining things in the project
		file.  Also fixing nits that let this compile without
		warnings on VS 2005.
	* airy_maker.vcproj : Same.
	* base_camera_server.cpp : Same.
	* file_stack_server.cpp : Same.
	* video.sln : Same.

2007-07-29  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* video.sln : Removed obsolete project.
	* *.vcproj : Added a definition to make the compiler not complain
		about using printf() and friends.
	* base_camera_server.cpp : Removing lint that is complained about by
		the VS 2005 compiler.
	* base_camera_server.h : Same.
	* cooke_server.cpp : Same.
	* diaginc_server.cpp : Same.
	* roper_server.cpp : Same.
	* stack_collector.cpp : Same.

2007-07-20  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>

	* glui_take.cpp:
		- added 0.1 and 0.01 frames per second to frame rate drop down.
		- Increased version number to 0.30
		- Fixed gain control.  Now it doesn't crash. 
	* glui_take.qsp: updated installer file.
	* GLUItake.dsp: updated project settings.
	
2007-07-16  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : Version 5.11 has a button that lets
		you cause lost spots to be autodeleted.  Had to redo the
		"lost" code to be thread-safe.  Added a "pop" sound when
		deleting beads.

2007-05-22  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* video_imager_server.cpp : Changed the version number because I
		recompiled to make a new server.  For some reason, the
		Roper server on version 2.06 was not accepting connections
		on its VRPN port.  Recompiling fixed it.  No idea why.

2007-05-15  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* cismm_video_optimizer.cpp : It now rewinds video files before trying
		to read the first frame.  It also puts in all-positive defaults
		for the frame size to match changes in the base classes.
	* average_videos.cpp : Changed the defaults as with the video optimizer.
	* SEM_camera_server.cpp : Added more info to error message.

2007-05-14  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* cissm_video_optimizer.cpp : Changed path from D: drive to C: drive.
	* cismm_video_optimizer.dsp : Added path to platform SDK for linking.

2007-03-07  Ryan Schubert  <res@cs.unc.edu>

	* file_list.* : Changed underlying data structure from std::list
		to std::vector.
	* file_stack_server.* : Same.

2007-03-01  Ryan Schubert  <res@cs.unc.edu>

	* video_z_tracker.vcproj : added new project to solution.

2007-02-22  Ryan Schubert  <res@cs.unc.edu>

	* *.vcproj : Added Visual Studio 8 (.NET 2005) project files that
		fix the PVOID64 error (by including the platform SDK
		Include directory first) and with _CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS
		defined to avoid deprecation compiler warnings.
	* Added video.sln VS8 solution file.

2007-01-31  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* *.vcproj : Getting rid of Visual Studio 2003 versions
		to replace them soon with Visual Studio 2005
		versions.

2007-01-24  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* base_camera_server.cpp : Fixing ambiguous cast for Visual Studio
		.NET 2003.
	* image_wrapper.cpp : Same.
	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : Same.
	* *.vcproj : Visual Studio .NET 2003 project files.

		where each layer in the file is played as a separate frame.
	* file_stack_server.h : Same.
	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : Updated version number.

2006-11-11  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* VST_multi_file_script.bat : A script that you can drop
		a bunch of video files onto and it will try to track
		a bead with specified precision and location in each
		of them.  For Ricky Spero.

2006-11-09  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* video_imager_server.cpp : Changed so that it sets the range with
		the min larger than the max, which means "however large the
		whole image is."  Before it was trying to read a region of
		size 1 pixel (0,0,0,0);

2006-11-04  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* video_imager_server.dsp : Fixing include path.
	* video_spot_tracker.dsp : Same.

		versions of Microsoft SDKs (Release only).

2006-10-05  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* stack_collector.dsp : Modified to link with the new versions
		of the Microsoft SDKs (Release only under Visual Studio
		version 6).
	* video_imager_server_directx_only.dsp : same.
	* video_spot_tracker.dsp : Same.

2006-09-23  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* video_imager_server.dsp : Changed include paths for the
		new version of DirectShow.

2006-09-23  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* directx_camera_server.h : Updated comments.

2006-09-23  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* DirectShow_baseclasses.dsp : Switching to the latest version
		of DirectShow, which lives in the platform SDK now.  It
		does not include Visual Studio projects to make the
		libraries, so I made one that includes the needed files.
	* directx_camera_server.cpp : Updated to work with the latest
		version of DirectShow.
	* directx_librarldsp : Same.
	* directx_vidfeofile_server.cpp : Same.
	* video.dsw : Same.
	* video_imager_server.cpp : Added #defines to let us build this
		with only a DirectX input, so that it can be built by
		those without scientific cameras.
	* video_imager_server_directx_only.dsp : Project to build a
		server without the scientific cameras in it.

2006-09-12  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* make_moving_spot_video.cpp : Changed background value to be
		fractional value to match the other parameters.

2006-09-12  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* edt_server.cpp : Guarded definition of min() to avoid warning.
	* spot_tracker.cpp : Modified all of the single optimization step
		code to check both the + and - direction to find the minimum
		before taking a step.  This should remove bias from the
		estimates that was revealed by tests with noisy images.
	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : Added a command-line argument to let
		it be started with a rod tracker.  This is being released
		as version 05.09.

2006-09-11  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* compare_tracking_files.cpp : Added option to compare and print
		angle differences.

2006-09-11  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* image_wrapper.h : Whitespace change.
	* image_wrapper.cpp : Error message fix.
	* make_moving_spot_video.cpp : Don't report angle change
		for symmetric objects.

2006-09-11  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* image_wrapper.cpp : Added a rod_image class, which is
		like the disc class but it makes a rod.
	* image_wrapper.h : Same.
	* make_moving_spot_video.cpp : Add an argument for doing
		rod trackers.  When going in a circle or spiral, they
		face along the direction of travel (approximate for
		spiral).  Added entry for "random" motion in addition
		to circle and spiral.
	* make_test_image.cpp : Made it compile with current ImageMagick.
	* make_test_image.dsp : Same.

2006-09-11  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* directx_library.dsp : Adding ^Ms back in.
	* roper_library.dsp : Same.
	* edt_library.dsp : Same.  Also, making it work with the
		EDT files installed on $(SYSTEMDRIVE) rather than C:

2006-09-06  Ryan Schubert	<res@cs.unc.edu>

	* directx_library.dsp : Added include path for dshow.h
	* roper_library.dsp : Fixed CR LF problems
	* edt_library.dsp : added new files for new version of library

2006-08-30  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* directx_library.dsp : Made it work with the include files
		located on $(SYSTEMDRIVE) not just D:.  ALSO, had to
		enable default include paths (it was turned off for
		one configuration?????)
	* roper_library.dsp : Same.

2006-08-28  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* stack_collector.cpp : Added an estimator for the offset between the
		requested position of the stage and its actual position.
		Increased the version number. Increased the number of
		pixels in the Roper camera to 14 from 12 (some of our
		cameras have 14 bits).  Writes to grayscale TIFFs rather
		than color ones, and also sets the gain and offset
		appropriately now (bug fix).

2006-08-23  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : Fixed off-by-one memory allocation
		bug that caused crashes randomly when using the command
		line to specify an output file name.

2006-07-30  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* Makefile : Compiles VST under Linux.  On my machine, you
		need to build Tcl/Tk and ImageMagick using static-
		only (--disable-shared) for the program to run
		after it has linked.
	* edt_server.cpp : Made the raw Pulnix file code work
		with Linux; the camera driver does not.
	* edt_server.h : Same.
	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : Explicitly set things to NULL
		that should be NULL.  Moved initial window positions
		over to the right for Linux.
	* Tcl_Linkvar85.C : Version of Tcl_Linkvars that work with
		Tcl/Tk 8.5.  Leaving the old ones in for Windows because
		they work with the NSRG Runtime.
	* Tcl_Linkvar85.h : Same.

2006-07-29  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* Makefile : Getting closer to making VST compile under Linux.
	* SEM_camera_server.h : Turned off compilation for non-Windows.
	* cooke_server.h : Same.
	* diaginc_server.h : Same.
	* directx_camera_server.h : Same.
	* directx_videofile_server.h : Same.
	* roper_server.h : Same.
	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : Doing scope-by-scope turning off
		of compilation.  Then doing an architecture-based
		turning on/off of the scopes.

2006-07-29  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* Makefile : Start of the process to make this build under
		Linux.  The test_spot_tracker app builds.
	* add_noise_to_image.cpp : Newline at the end of the file.
	* base_camera_server.cpp : Removed call to base class virtual
		destructor.
	* base_camera_server.h : Comment change.
	* file_list.cpp : uses stat() under Linux, rather than _stat()
	* file_stack_server.h : Newline at end of file.
	* image_wrapper.cpp : Declared return type for method.
	* image_wrapper.h : Same.
	* spot_tracker.cpp : Explicit double-to-int conversions.
	* spot_tracker.h : Same.
	* test_spot_tracker.cpp : Uses unlink() rather than _unlink() on Linux.

2006-07-24  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* directx_camera_server.cpp : Initializes _buffer to NULL so that
		it doesn't get set to a random thing and than cause a crash
		at exit if passed a bogus file name.
	* directx_video_server.cpp : Same.
	* make_moving_spot_video.cpp : Make Usage() match the code.
	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : White-space changes

2006-07-17  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* make_moving_spot_video.cpp : Added a CSV file output the tells where
		the spots were located.  Also flips the image in Y so that the
		video-spot-tracker reported positions match.  Added version
		number (1.0).
	* airy_maker.cpp : Added a CSV file output the tells where the spots
		were located.  Changed the version number.

2006-07-14  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* image_wrapper.cpp : Centered the disc-generation program so that
		the disc is centered on the pixel rather than at the edge.
	* make_moving_spot_video.cpp : New program to help test the spot
		tracking.
	* make_moving_spot_video.dsp : Project to build it.
	* test_spot_tracker.cpp : Comment about bias.
	* video.dsw : Added project to build the moving spot video.

2006-07-12  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* video_imager_server.cpp : Fixed a bug where it was naming the
		channels "mono", "green", and "blue".  This confused the
		poor receiver of color images.  Now it does either "mono"
		or "red, green, blue".

2006-07-08  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* add_noise_to_image.cpp : Added Gaussian noise and a camera
		offset.
	* airy_maker.cpp : Made it so that the program does not clip
		the pattern to the on-screen preview window size, but
		makes it the whole 31x31 pixels at least.

2006-07-08  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* add_noise_to_image.cpp : Modified to include Poisson shot-noise
		as well as dark current.  Also made it not use the same
		random-number seed every time unless you tell it to.

2006-07-08  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* cismm_video_optimizer.cpp : Fixed a bug where the gain and offset
		for the saved frame come from the next frame's values.

2006-07-06  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : Switched to using the constant from
		VPRN that says how many tracker sensors there can be, rather
		than making up our own here which can't be larger than that
		one anyway.  This lets us do up to 500 sensors with the
		new setting in VRPN.

2006-06-30  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* airy_maker.cpp : Changed the specification of brightness to be
		in terms of number of photons and photon/count in the
		image.  Changed noise to be Poisson noise on dark current
		and on photons.  Changed the way we ensure a large enough
		image size so that it also computes dark current and noise
		over the whole image.  Using the STOCC random-number
		generator to get Poisson noise, so need to add GPL info
		into a README that goes along with the installer.

2006-06-29  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* airy_maker.cpp : Modified to make the default parameters closer
		to what is found in the Selvin test code.  Modified to make
		the minimum output file size 31x31 pixels.
	* video.dsw : Added project files for STOCC random-number
		generation library and a test program that came with it.

2006-06-15  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* image_wrapper.cpp : Adding a Gaussian image, which does not
		integrate but simply point-samples.  This is to support
		the FIONA kernel.
	* image_wrapper.h : Same.
	* spot_math.h : Same.
	* spot_tracker.cpp : Switched the FIONA implementation away from doing
		integration of a Gaussian to just doing point-sampling of the
		Gaussian to match the implementation in the Selvin lab.  Also made
		the optimization function always optimize the radius, background,
		and volume within the Gaussian.
	* spot_tracker.h : Same.
	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : Same.
	* video_spot_trcker.tcl : Put FIONA interface back in.

2006-06-13  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : Added command-line arguments that let
		you run the program and start trackers and have it log and
		then quit at the end of a file sequence.  This is to let Ty
		run it in a script harness and determine how well the
		trackers work.

2006-06-07  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : Updated the version number for a new
		release.

2006-06-06  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : Makes the mouse motion and clicks match
		the resized video window, so that if we're using OpenGL for
		display of the texture, everything lines up correctly.  This
		means that the user can resize the window and that images
		that are narrower than the window is wide will display
		consistently.

2006-06-06  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* average_videos.cpp : Removed extra M_PI definition.
	* directx_camera_server.cpp : Made it use BGR texture rather than
		RGB texture so that the colors don't swap.
	* directx_camera_server.h : Same.
	* spot_tracker.h : Made it specify the color channel to use (so that
		it didn't always track channel 0).
	* spot_tracker.cpp : Same.
	* cismm_video_optimizer.cpp : Same.
	* test_spot_tracker.cpp : Same.
	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : Same.

2006-05-26  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* SEM_camera_server.cpp : Fixed problem that caused the SEM
		videos to replay very slowly on some computers (removed
		sleep call in an inner loop).
	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : Bumped version number

2006-05-23  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* SEM_camera_server.cpp : Fixed problems that caused it to miss
		frames and also to hang up at the end of the file.
	* SEM_camera_server.h : Same.
	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : Added 3D translucent surface display
		for debugging FIONA.

2006-05-18  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* video_spot_tracker.tcl : Removing FIONA control from display.
	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : Changing version number.

2006-05-09  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* spot_tracker.cpp : Fixed a bug in the radius-optimization
		code that was causing the radius always to squash down
		to size 1.
	* video_spot_tracker.tcl : Increased the size of the textbox
		for the error value.
	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : Made FIONA tracker optimize the
		radius as well as the position.

2006-05-09  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* airy_maker.cpp : Lets it take steps between saving frames
		when it is logging.  Bumped version number to 01.03.

2006-04-27  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* airy_maker.cpp : Made it write out TIFF stacks.  Still not
		the correct noise model.
	* airy_maker.dsp : Same.
	* airy_maker.tcl : Same.
	* base_camera_server.h : Comment changes.
	* file_stack_server.cpp : Same.

2006-04-17  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* video_imager_server.cpp : Added back in a command-line argument
		for swapping lines on the EDT/Pulnix, because that bug seems
		to be back in the driver sometimes.

2006-04-04  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : Multi-threaded the trackers, so that
		it will make as many threads as there are processors.  This
		speeds up the tracking of more than one spot at a time.

2006-03-29  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : Increased the number of available
		trackers in VRPN from 100 to 500.  FIONA tracker has not
		yet been debugged completely.

2006-03-27  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* glui_take.cpp:
		- Increased version number to 0.20
		- Added gain control.  Now you can adjust the gain of the camera within glui_take instead of going into pdvshow to do it.
		- Added "abort acquisition" button to interrupt data collection.
	* glui_take.qsp: updated installer file.
	* glui_take.bat: removed batch variables and replaced them with environ var.

2006-03-10  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* airy_maker.cpp : Cosmetic changes.
	* image_wrapper.cpp : Added Gaussian function estimator

	* video_spot_tracker.tcl : Same.

2006-02-26  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* base_camera_server.cpp : Added several methods to enable direct
		rendering from cameras into an OpenGL Quad through a texture,
		which enables much faster rendering.  This lets us send a
		single channel to the graphics card for one-color cameras,
		using the OpenGL offset and scale built-in hardware and
		duplication to all three channels.  Also works for RGB
		cameras, and is faster.  Also changed the semantics of the
		send_vrpn_image so that it requires a separate read call to
		the camera.
	* base_camera_server.h : Same.
	* cooke_server.h : Same.
	* cooke_server.cpp : Same.
	* diaginc_server.h : Same.
	* diaginc_server.cpp : Same.
	* directx_camera_server.h : Same.
	* directx_camera_server.cpp : Same.
	* edt_server.h : Same.
	* edt_server.cpp : Same.

	* file_stack_server.cpp : Same.
	* nikon_server.h : Same.
	* nikon_server.cpp : Same.
	* roper_server.h : Same.
	* roper_server.cpp : Same.
	* SEM_camera_server.h : Same.
	* SEM_camera_server.cpp : Same.
	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : Makes use of the faster OpenGL rendering,
		and modified the bit-shifting code to be consistent between
		different bit-depth cameras.
	* video_imager_server.cpp : Modified to read from the camera before
		sending its image via the VRPN imager server.
	* cismm_video_optimizer.cpp : Modified to still work with the changes
		made.  Not yet optimized to use them.

2006-02-17  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* cismm_video_optimizer.cpp : Added Cooke camera.
	* cooke_server.cpp : Bug fixes; this version has consistent
		behavior when binning and also avoids crashing at
		exit.
	* cooke_server.h : Same.
	* video.dsw : Added Cooke server.
	* video_imager_server.cpp : Same.
	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : Same.

2006-02-17  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* airy_maker.cpp : Added some noise creation into the imaging
		process.  It isn't done yet, shot noise is not complete.
	* diaginc_server.cpp : Took out a large commented-out block.
	* roper_server.cpp : Error message fixed.
	* cooke_server.h : Added class to drive a Cooke camera using the
		PCO library.
	* cooke_server.cpp : Same.
	* cooke_server.dsp : Same.
	* video.dsw : Added Cooke camera server.
	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : Same.
	* video_imager_server.cpp : Same.
	* video_imager_server.dsp : Same.

2006-02-06  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : Removes VRPNLogToMatlab installer; it
		is now available as a separate package with its own
		version number. Rearranged the GUI elements to keep from
		making the left panel too long. Consolidated the logging
		control panel into the kernel control panel. Made round
		cursors the default, now that we have such nice ones. :-)
		Turns off tracking and deletes traces when rewind is pushed.
		This was requested by a user to be the behavior, and it
		certainly seems likely to be the common case. Made the "round
		cursor" option for the rod3 tracker display something useful.
		In this case, a rectangle with lines coming in. 
	* video_spot_tracker.tcl : Same.

2006-02-03  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* video_imager_server.cpp : This wasn't calling mainloop()
		on the connection object.  Now it does.  Version 2.3.
		Strangely, this only showed up when the remote side
		requested logging.

2006-02-02  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : Adds a trace of the logged bead positions
		that can be drawn over the video image.

2006-01-27  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* cismm_video_optimizer.cpp : Adds "Thank-you Ware" button.

2006-01-27  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

2005-12-13  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* cismm_video_optimizer.cpp : Makes the display slightly faster by
		caching calculations.

2005-12-12  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* base_camera_server.h : Added a pixel read function to
		the imager base class that lets easily swap out
		cameras for imagers in spot tracker.
	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : Made the video display faster using
		smarter pointer arithmetic.  Added the ability to subtract
		an average background image from the image on which tracking
		is occuring.

2005-12-12  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* base_camera_server.h : Allows saving monochrome TIFF images.
	* base_camera_server.cpp : Same.
	* cismm_video_optimzer.cpp : Same.
	* cismm_video_optimizer.tcl : Same.

2005-12-12  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : Turned the RGB slider into a set of
		radiobuttons, moved the description of them into the
		Tcl file.
	* video_spot_tracker.tcl : Same.
	* cismm_video_optimizer.cpp : Same.
	* cismm_video_optimizer.tcl : Same.

2005-12-12  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* airy_maker.cpp : Now calculates an image based on the current
		parameter settings and then uses that image for display
		purposes both in the bar graph and in the simulated image.
	* airy_maker.tcl : Made a big "Quit" button.
	* spot_math.h : Moved an Airy integration function into this
		file, so that it can be shared by other programs.

2005-12-08  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* airy_maker.cpp : Adds a display of the brightness image,
		including the addition of noise to the image -- both
		uniform noise and noise scaled by the brightness of
		each pixel.
	* spot_math.h : Modified to do a better job at handling
		cases near the center of the sample space.

2005-11-16  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* average_videos.cpp : This version works, with multiple files
		named on the command line.  It also has an option (not
		exposed in the installed shortcut) that lets you say
		how many frames to average from each of the following
		files on the command line.

2005-11-16  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* cismm_video_optimizer.cpp : Moved the display code out of the
		loop-in-Y code, making it a lot faster.  What a stupid bug.
		Updated version number to 1.09.
	* average_videos.cpp : New application to compute the average frame
		from a video or series of TIFF files.  It isn't quite done in
		this version.
	* average_videos.dsp : Project file to build the above.
	* video.dsw : Added the above project.

2005-08-11  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* edt_library.dsp : Modified to look on the system drive for
		libraries, not the C: drive.
	* video_imager_server.cpp : Changed the version number to 2.2
	* video_spot_tracker.dsp : Set it to look in system drive for
		include files rather than C:

2005-08-08  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* roper_server.cpp : Modified to handle binning with VRPN Imager.
	* video_imager_server.bat : Modified to send multiple parameters if
		they exist.
	* video_imager_server.qsp : Builds version 02.00.

2005-07-27  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* cismm_video_optimizer.cpp : Fixed a bug in the reorientation code.
		Updated version number to 1.08.

2005-07-19  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	glui_take.dsp : 
		- changed configuration to include vrpn headers and vrpn.lib.
	glui_take.cpp : 
		- changed timestamps to UTC format.  Output text file is now 
		  similar to vrpn-log output.
		- made interface more friendly by removing desired number of
			frames and number of frames to skip.  Instead the user inputs
			the desired duration for frame capture and the desired frame-rate
			from a selection.

2005-07-15  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

        * GLUItake.dsp : Switching over everything to use the compiled
		version of ImageMagick which has static linkage and does not
		require an installed ImageMagick library.  Also, modifying all
		of the preprocessor paths and include paths to point at
		external in C:\nsrg rather than relative paths.  Also, removing
		extra entries in these lists that used to be needed.
        * airy_maker.dsp : Same.
        * argonot.cpp : Same.
        * argonot.dsp : Same.
        * base_camera_server.dsp : Same.
        * cismm_video_optimizer.dsp : Same.

2005-07-14  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : Fixed a bug that caused positions to be
		logged to the logfile when a tracker is lost.  Version 4.02.

2005-07-14  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* nikon_camera.dsp : Adds a project to build controls for Nikon
		cameras.  Does not yet compile, but wanted to check in before
		other changes made.  This is for controlling the D1 and D2X
		cameras that are used by the Rheology mixing group.
	* nikon_server.cpp : Same.
	* nikon_server.h : Same.
	* video.dsw : Same.

2005-07-14  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>

* glui_take.cpp : 
		- Incremented VERSION_STRING to 0.11 from 0.10a.
		- Added feature for saving timestamps via EDTpdv function call to 
		  pdv_wait_image_timed.  Timestamps are accumulated while images 
			are streamed to the disk and then saved in a separate file.  
			The physical value of the timestamps are in seconds since bootup.
			Using vrpn_gettimeofday would be better and will be used soon.
		- Added informational text describing software version and 
			camera parameters.
	* glui_take.bat :
		- Added this batch file that loads the camera configuration and
			initializes the camera before starting glui_take.cpp.

2005-07-08  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* SEM_camera_server.cpp : Removed Synchronized from VRPN connections.
	* SEM_camera_server.h : Same.
	* diaginc_server.cpp : Same.

	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : Same.

2005-06-06  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* base_camera_server.h : Modified to use an unsynchronized VRPN
		connection, which has been removed from VRPN.
	* diaginc_server.h : Same.
	* directx_camera_server.h : Same.
	* edt_server.h : Same.
	* roper_server.h : Same.
	* video_imager_server.cpp : Same.

2005-05-06  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* directx_videofile_server.cpp : Fixed error messages (copy/paste
		error left wrong class name).
	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : Added a bit "Quit" button, rather than
		the small check-box hidden down in the "Sea of Tcl".  Also
		added a "tell if I'm lost" feature that stops the tracking
		when a tracker has too small of a signal on a bead.
	* lost.wav : The sound it plays when it gets lost.

2005-04-29  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* stack_collector.cpp : Adds a field that controls how many
		images are taken at one focal plane and another that
		sets the minimum delay between images.
	* stack_collector.tcl : Same.
	* video_imager_server.cpp : Comment changes.

2005-04-27  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* mcl.cfg : Edited to work correctly, had a bug before in
		the arguments to the MCL control.
	* stack_collector.cpp : Moved a lot of the interface into
		a TCL script.  Made it work with the MCL stage as well
		as the Nikon stage.  Made it work with the Pulnix
		camera.  Tested it running on Hercules with installer.
	* stack_collector.tcl : Same.
	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : Start of changes to include a
		"I think I'm lost" function.  For now, just printouts
		that need to be disabled again later.  Also moved "Quit"
		button into TCL script.
	* video_spot_tracker.tcl : Same.

2005-02-17  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* cismm_video_optimizer.cpp : Version number change to match
		documentation change.
	* video_imager_server.cpp : Changed the name of the sent stream
		from "red" to "mono" so it will show up in all three
		channels in the default reader.

2005-02-02  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* stack_collector.cpp : Modified so that it uses a remote
		Tracker and Poser object on top of an Analog and
		AnalogOut object to drive either a Nikon base or
		the Mad City Labs stage.  The MCL code does not yet
		let you control the stage position from within the
		program, so focus control on Nikon needs to be used
		to set up.
	* nikon.cfg : Configuration file to run a VRPN server that
		wraps a Nikon with an appropriate Poser and Tracker.
	* mcl.cfg : Configuration file to run a VRPN server that
		wraps a pair of National Instruments boards with
		appropriate Tracker and Poser for positioning.
	* stack_collector.dsp : Modified to build new version.

2005-01-24  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : Version 4.00.  Changes the output
		format for CSV files to include frame number from video
		rather than time at which the info was saved: time was
		not with respect to video frame time before, so this is
		an improvement.  Adds an Analog to the VRPN file to tell
		the frame number.

2005-01-20  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* stack_collector.cpp : Version 2.01. Watches for focus change
		during preview.  Lets the user specify a minimum time
		lapse between stacks.

2005-01-11  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* SEM_camera_server.cpp : Modified the VRPN send method to take

	* edt_server.h : Same.
	* edt_server.cpp : Same.
	* file_stack_server.h : Same.
	* file_stack_server.cpp : Same.
	* roper_server.h : Same.
	* roper_server.cpp : Same.
	* video_tempimager_server.h : Same.  Also added code to decide the
		maximum value based on the camera.  Also added code to have it
		write 3 channels from the DirectX camera server.

2004-12-21  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : Added EDT camera control, so I can
		try this with the Pulnix and see how fast it is.

2004-12-17  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* edt_server.cpp : Fixed error message.
	* roper_server.cpp : Added Roper SPE stack file reader.
	* roper_server.h : Same.
	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : Same.
	* video_spot_tracker.tcl : Same.

2004-12-07  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* video.dsw : Changed tempimager projects to imager projects

2004-11-19  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* base_camera_server.cpp : Override the default copy
		constructor on the copy_of_image class so that
		it does a deep copy.  Added an everaged_image
		class that averages two images.
	* base_camera_server.h : Same.
	* cismm_video_optimizer.tcl : Added a control to subtract
		the average of neighboring images from the current
		image (attempt at Z sharpening).
	* cismm_video_optimizer.cpp : Same.
	* edt_library.dsp : Removed file not needed in new
		version (3.3.3.5) of the EDT library.
	* edt_server.cpp : Implemented the code to send a
		message on a VRPN connection.
	* edt_server.h : Changed the swap-lines default parameter
		to false, because this bug was fixed in version
		3.3.3.5 of the EDT library.
	* video.dsw : Changed dependencies.
	* video_tempimager_server.cpp : Added EDT as a camera type.

2004-11-12  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* base_camera_server.cpp : Added virtual destructors to
		remove memory leak.
	* base_camera_server.h : Same.
	* cismm_video_optimizer.cpp : Shifts the image intensities
		for 8-bit file saves so that they match what is shown
		on the screen.

		the imagemix control panel.

2004-11-11  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* cismm_video_optimizer.cpp : Making the code to turn on and
		off collection of min/max/mean a bit more clever so that
		it can be left off as desired.

2004-11-11  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* cismm_video_optimizer.cpp : Added code for auto gain control.
		Handled the case where the user turns off the gathering
		of statistics that are being used by turning off their
		use at the same time.
	* cismm_video_optimizer.tcl : Added code for auto gain control.

2004-11-11  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* base_camera_server.cpp : Added new methods to base classes so
		that they can be used more widely.  Added new image-subtract

	* stack_collector.dsp : Made to link with new needed things.
	* video.dsw : Added dependencies.
	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : Removed the imager class, which is
		now redundant with the camera as they are derived from
		the same class.

2004-09-23  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* spot_tracker.cpp : Adds a parabolic really-fast tracking
		optimization technique that fails spectacularly.
		Adds a much-faster twolines_ version of the image-based
		spot tracker that is much faster and seems to be almost
		as robust as the full-image one.
	* spot_tracker.h : Same.
	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : Puts the faster image spot tracker
		in, swapping it out for the slower one.  Now logs the
		last frame's tracker positions when the program is quit
		or log-file closed.  Adds the ability to do velocity-
		based prediction on tracker position updates that lets
		us really reduce the radius for the jump_test kernel
		and improve tracking speed.
	* video_spot_tracker.tcl : US code for the above changes.

2004-09-21  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : Adds Jpeg to the file types loaded.

2004-09-15  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : Checked to make sure it does not try
		to create too many trackers.  If it tries, then it just
		stops trying (it used to make them and then not log them).
		Also, avoids resetting the tracker IDs when the user
		switches kernel type.
	* SEM_library.dsp : Switched back to DLL code generation.
	* airy_maker.dsp : Same.
	* argonot.dsp : Same.
	* diaginc_library.dsp : Same.

2004-09-07  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* base_camera_server.h : Modified this so that the camera base
		class derives from image_wrapper, to avoid duplicating
		code and excessive subclassing.  Added classes to make
		a copy of an image and to transform an image.
	* base_camera_server.cpp : Implements above code.
	* file_stack_server.h : Same.
	* image_wrapper.cpp : Code moved and adjusted per above.
	* image_wrapper.h : Same.

	* video_tempimager_server.dsp : Same.
	* file_list.h : Turned off warning about too-long debug symbols.
	* file_stack_server.cpp : Created compile-time flag USE_METAMORPH
		to determine whether it tries to compile in new code that
		can read Metamorph files directly.  New class to do this.
		The new class does not yet work (it doesn't understand the
		specialized tags and doesn't know how to parse the data).
	* file_stack_server.h : Same, plus comment changes and turning
		off compile-time warning for too-long symbols.
	* spot_tracker.cpp : Computes variance across rings, part of
		a failed attempt to make the symmetric spot tracker
		have a larger capture radius.
	* spot_tracker.h : Whitespace change.
	* stack_collector.cpp : Comment change.
	* video_spot_tracker.bat : Can't see any change.
	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : Added configuration section to turn
		on and off which external libraries are being used.  Added
		entries for ROPER and METAMORPH.  Made the program never
		re-use an index for a tracker that has been deleted.  This
		avoids confusion in the analysis process.
	* video.dsw : Added project file for manual_capture.
	* video_spot_tracker.html : Added comment about Windows XP SP2
		firewall complaining when the program is run.

2004-08-03  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* file_stack_library.dsp : Making things compile with most stuff
		installed on D: rather than C: due to hard drive crash.
	* roper_library.dsp : Same.
	* video_spot_tracker.dsp : Same.
	* video.dsw : Same.  Added project file for test image program.
	* image_wrapper.cpp : Extra error checking.  Changes in the way
		the disc test image is made to support oversampling.
		New "Copy_of_image" class that will copy itself from
		any wrapped class and then report the copied values.
		This is used for the image-based tracker.
	* image_wrapper.h : Same.
	* spot_tracker.cpp : Made a new image-based spot tracker that
		does least-squares differences between two images to
		determine the error.  This is used by the new code in
		the video spot tracker program that tries to follow
		bead jumps between frames.
	* spot_tracker.h : Same.
	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : Turned off compiler warning about too-long
		symbol names.  Changed the way the kernel is chosen so that
		it uses a switch statement rather than a set of checkboxes.
		Moved some GUI code into the Tcl script from the C code.
		Added code to do image-based search for maximum within one
		radius of a bead, so that it could track faster bead motion.
		Added frame-number counter when using video.
	* video_spot_tracker.tcl : Moved some GUI code into here, made the
		kernel window display clearer.

2004-03-23  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* Tcl_Linkvar.C : Making sure that strings don't get written past
		the allocated space.
	* Tcl_Linkvar.h : Comments added.
	* edt_server.cpp : Inverting the image to match what is seen on the
		preview program that comes with the board.
	* file_list.cpp : Changed to work when given a file that has no
		numbers in it.
	* file_stack_server.cpp : Modified to work properly with either 8
		or 16-bit input files.
	* kernel.jpg : New image for web manual.
	* log.jpg : Same.
	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : Inverted the handling of Y throughout
		the program to avoid flipping everything over twice.
		Changed the output values for Y so that they are indexed from
		the upper-left corner rather than the lower-left corner.
		Made the program work when it has no trackers, and not have
		one when it starts.  Changing the Tcl X and Y variables to
		be output-only, to avoid truncating the position stored in
		the log file.  Made it possible to delete the active tracker
		using Delete and Backspace keys.  Made it possible to quit
		by pressing Q or q.  Changed the way the mouse buttons and
		drags work: left now creates new ones and sets radius;
		right now drags the nearest one around on the screen.  Moved
		the windows around to fit on the screen better with all the
		new controls.
	* video_spot_tracker.html : Updated to describe all of the above
		changes.
	* video_spot_Tracker.tcl : Moved windows around, changed where

		new features.
	* GUI.jpg : Updated with the new control panel image.
	* video_spot_tracker.tcl : Updated to let the user select a TIFF or

2004-03-04  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* file_list.h : Function to produce a list of the files in a
		directory that are in a numbered sequence given
		the name of one of the files.
	* file_list.cpp : Same.
	* file_stack_server.h : Image server that reads a stack of
		images and spits them out as if they were a video.
		Currently only works with 8-bit images because it
		links with the nano-compiled version of ImageMagick.
	* file_stack_server.cpp : Same.
	* video.dsw : Adding project to read image stacks
	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : Same

2004-03-02  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* directx_videofile_server.cpp : Make the destructor and the
		rewind buttons each wait for the filter graph to
		finish (by reading an extra frame).  This prevents
		the code from hanging when it is rewound or quit
		while playing and tracking.
	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : Makes the program exit cleanly when
		the OpenGL window is closed, and when the one of the initial
		Tcl/Tk windows are closed.  Should also exit somewhat
		cleanly if the job is killed some other way.
	* video_spot_tracker.html : Described the changes, bumped the
		version number.

2004-02-16  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : Modified to use a new version of the
		VRPN File Connection that is able to avoid preloading
		the file and avoid loading it all into memory.

	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : Added code to draw a center-of-spindle
		graph along with the kymograph.  Renamed kinograph to
		kymograph throughout.  Added chartjunk for spindle tracking
		when the kymograph is turned on.

	* image_wrapper.cpp : Same.
	* test_spot_tracker.cpp : Same.

2004-01-31  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : Fixed a bug that made it complain
		about not having a CSV file open when it wasn't supposed
		to.  Added a Kinograph function that displays the
		line of the image through two tracked points.

2004-01-30  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* GUI.jpg : Updated picture to newer version.
	* kernel.jpg : Same.
	* spot_tracker.cpp : Added a new rod3 kernel that includes three
		kernels in a line that move as one rigid unit.  This is
		intended to let the user track rods in the image.  It
		can use any of the other kernels as subkernels.  Refactored
		some of the code to use accessor methods rather than
		direct reads so that the proper side effects occur.
	* spot_tracker.h : Same.
	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : Added support for control and reading
		of the rod parameters.  Modified rewind so that it first
		pauses, which is hoped to cure a problem with the program
		hanging on rewind for DirectX files.  Added code to save
		.csv files as well as .vrpn files when logging.
	* video_spot_tracker.dsp : Same.
	* video_spot_tracker.html : Updated to new version.
	* video_spot_tracker.tcl : Updates to GUI to support above changes.

2004-01-07  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* SEM_camera_server.cpp : Code needed to parse the VRPN-format
		files that contain information from an SEM interface.
		This is to let us read the optical images taken during
		manipulations with the nanoManipulator + optical
		system, which uses an SEM interface to talk to the nM.
	* SEM_camera_server.h : Same.
	* SEM_library.dsp : Same.
	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : Added code to handle SEM VRPN data
		produced by the optical image server.  Modified the code
		that logs so that it stores the value for a frame just as
		the user leaves the frame, enabling single-stepping through
		the frames and fixing the positions of any trackers that get
		lost due to rapid motion.  Added a client_tracker so that
		log files will have acknowledgements of the tracker server
		in them.
	* video_spot_tracker.dsp : Added parameters needed to compile with
		the SEM library.
	* video_spot_tracker.html : Updated to version 25, described the
		logging differences.
	* video_tempimager_server.dsp : Added parameters needed to compile
		with teh SEM library.
	* video.dsw : Added SEM projects and other projects needed to
		read from SEM VRPN files.

2003-11-18  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* airy_maker : Installer for the Airy-disk maker program.
	* airy_maker.cpp : Adds sqrt() display above Airy cross-section.
		Draws cross-hairs to show pixel center.
	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : Adds option to tag tracked spots using
		larger circles around them rather than cross-hairs through
		them.  Tags each tracked marker with a number that matches
		their sensor number in the VRPN log file.

2003-11-15  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* airy_maker.cpp : Shows probability distribution within the pixels

		airy for both X and Y.
	* roper_server.cpp : Fixes the stride calculations.
	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : Adds a parameter to control the
		resolution to which the tracker tracks.

2003-08-30  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* image_wrapper.h : Speeding up bilerp function a bit.
	* spot_tracker.cpp : Speeding up tracker a bit.
	* stack_collector.cpp : Changed version number.  Adds a button
		to let the code step one past the bottom of the stack
		to make sure we collect images coming the same direction
		all the time.
	* tempimager_directx_dll.cpp : First working version.  Only works
		if the VRPN server is running when the DLL is loaded.
		Hard-wired to localhost server for now.
	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : Added non-checking versions of pixel
		reads to see if things went faster with them.  They didn't.
	* video_spot_tracker.tcl : Sets default save location to C:\.

2003-08-26  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* image_wrapper.cpp : Moving virtual function inline to speed up
		inner loops.
	* image_wrapper.h : Same, plus tweaking the function for speed.
	* spot_tracker.cpp : Speed tweaks.  Major rework of the symmetric
		spot tracker to use pre-computed lists of positions rather
		than recomputing coordinates each frame.  This slowed it
		down until I turned the index operations into pointer++.
		Removed the broken version of the interpolating disk
		tracker.
	* spot_tracker.h : Same.

	* tempimager_directx_dll.dsp : Project file for same.

2003-08-15  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* argonot.cpp : Making it compile with the newer libraries.
	* directx_camera_server.cpp : Fixed bug where odd-sized video
		could not be read.  Also fixed bug where leaving the
		video size on a camera unspecified resulted in no video
		coming in.
	* directx_camera_server.h : Same.
	* directx_videofile_server.cpp : Copied new code over from the
		camera server above.

		where the spot is really brighter in the center.
	* spot_tracker.h : Same.
	* test_spot_tracker.cpp : Added test for cone.
	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : New version number.  Added ability
		to select which color from an RGB input.  Added
		ability to use the cone kernel.  Antialiased the cross
		lines, so they appear in the correct location.  Set up

2003-08-07  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* image_wrapper.h : Defaults to no noise.
	* spot_tracker.cpp : Fixes bug in initialization.  Pulled many of
		the disk_spot_tracker functions into the spot_tracker base
		class.  Made a new type of disk spot tracker that interpolates
		the values between pixels in the image, which does a better
		job of matching to sub-pixel locations.  Renamed original
		version that samples within the kernel but at the original
		resolution interp2: don't use it.
	* spot_tracker.h : Same.
	* test_spot_tracker.cpp : Modified to better test the subpixel
		behavior of the interpolating tracker.
	* vidso_spot_tracker.cpp : Changed version number.
	* video_spot_tracker.dsp : Not sure what the change was.  Added /Fr
		flag.

2003-08-04  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* base_camera_server.h : Removed _vrpn_buffer and _vrpn_buffer_size
		(unused?)
	* directx_camera_server.cpp : Removed filter_state (unused).
		Made grabber callback return all of its samples and exit
		when it is time to shut down.
	* directx_camera_server.h : Same.
	* directx_videofile_server.cpp : Use Pause() rather that Stop() to
		avoid locking up the callback handler for the grabber.
	* roper_server.cpp : Removed _vrpn_buffer and _size.
	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : Changed version.  Changed where the
		coordinates are flipped so that things are in the right
		system.

2003-08-04  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* base_camera_server.h : Comment changes.
	* diaginc_server.cpp : Still trying to debug.  It seems to copy
		with a stride that is smaller than it should be, but it
		doesn't seem to duplicate pixels.
	* directx_camera_server.cpp : Returns false rather than printing
		a message when the frame times out.  Lets higher-level
		code know, so that it can deal with it.  Also makes the
		rewind button read one frame after going to beginning.
	* directx_videofile_server.cpp : Makes the rewind button take a
		single step afterwards, so the user can see the first
		frame.
	* directx_videofile_server.h : Same.
	* image_wrapper.cpp : Includes a bilinear interpolation read
		routine.
	* image_wrapper.h : Same.
	* spot_tracker.cpp : Added a base class spot tracker, and derived
		disk spot tracker from it.  Derived interpolating disk
		spot tracker from that.  Interpolating one does bilerp on
		its pixels when optimizing, to do better at subpixel
		accuracy.
	* spot_tracker.h : Same.  Plus more access functions for the
		member variables.
	* test_spot_tracker.cpp : Added more tests.  Added interp tracker.
	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : Added option to use interpolating
		disk tracker.  Added the ability to put in more than one
		spot tracker for the same image (using right mouse button).
		Created "flip_y()" utility function.  Make rewind play
		the first image in the video file.  Makes it not crash
		if you ask to overwrite a file.
	* video_spot_tracker.tcl : Added default "vrpn" extension to
		files.

2003-07-21  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* base_camera_server.h : Comments.
	* diaginc_server.cpp : Made the code work better than it did
		before.  It works, but has a strange subtraction of one
		line per column that I don't know why it needs.  It also
		reads the video upside-down.  Wanted to check it in because
		of the changes in the tracking program.
	* diaginc_server.h : Comments.
	* directx_camera_server.cpp : Some attempts to make this work with
		TV tuner cards.
	* roper_server.cpp : Comments.
	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : Use RGBA rather than RGB texture to
		avoid trouble with word alignment.  Also ensure that it is
		allocated on a 4-byte boundary.

2003-07-18  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* directx_camera_server.cpp : Changed the code to use the callback
		mechanism from the frame capture filter rather than asking
		it for the current frame; this only processes each frame
		one time, and it set the replay rate to a maximum of the
		image-generation rate.
	* directx_camera_server.h : Same.
	* directx_videofile_server.cpp : Same.
	* directx_videofile_server.h : Same.
	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : Changed comments and version number.

2003-06-17  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : Lets it compile in the new-better
		build environment where everything comes from external.

2003-06-16  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : File-saving dialog box to let the
		user save a log file.  Made the default spot a dark one.

2003-06-16  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* stack_collector.dsp : Changed to compile with files in new
		locations.

2003-06-12  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* directx_camera_server.cpp : Made it so that if you ask for a
		video of size 0x0 it just takes whatever the default
		resolution is for the camera.
	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : Enabled the user to open directx to
		get any resolution or directx640x480 to get that specific
		resolution.  Adds a button to return it to full-screen
		video display (opposite of small_area).

2003-04-03  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : Changing default exposure time to 80ms
		if we're using the SPOT camera -- this seems to be the
		minimum for our camera.
	* diaginc_server.cpp : Debugging to make it actually read an image.
		May or may not get the pixels in the right order.  May or
		may not do binning correctly (couldn't get on the microscope
		to test it).

2003-03-28  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : Adding Diagnostics Inc. SPOT camera
		interface as a choice for the camera to use.
	* video_tempimager_server.cpp : Adding Diagnostics Inc. SPOT camera
		interface as a choice for the camera to use.
	* diaginc_server.h : Server for Diagnostics Incorporated SPOT cameras.
	* diaginc_server.cpp : Server for Diagnostics Incorporated SPOT cameras.

2003-03-06  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : Added VRPN tracker to report position.

2003-03-06  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* base_camera_server.h : Declaring functions const.
	* directx_camera_server.cpp : Fixing pixel-lookup for subsetted images.
	* roper_server.cpp : Making pixel-reading work when binning.
	* spot_tracker.cpp : Changed the surround_frac to be smaller to make
		it track the center correctly.
	* stack_collector.cpp : Newline at end of file.
	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : Lots of changes.  Added mouse-based direction
		of point and radius.  Added ability to subset the display.
		Added auto-subsetting following the tracked area.  Lets you
		turn off the video display to speed things up.  Lets you
		track either dark or white spots.  Image inversion where
		needed in Y.  Debugging.  Doesn't post redisplay multiple
		times between displays.

2003-03-05  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

        * stack_collector.cpp : Made it so that you can select the region
                of interest with the mouse.  Bumped version number.

2003-03-04  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* base_camera_server.h : Adding a gain parameter when saving image.
	* roper_server.h : Same.
	* roper_server.cpp : Scales image values by gain and clips to the
		maximum value when saving.
	* stack_collecter.cpp: Added gain parameter when viewing and saving.
		Added ability to take multiple stacks.
		Changed output file to include gain and sequence #.
		Made things that should be integers truncate to do so.
		Made a new window for clipping controls.
	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : Switched to 12-bit values for Roper.

2003-02-28  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* stack_collector.cpp : Fixed where the right and top lines are to
		be outside the viewed area rather than on its edge.
		Renamed the clipping controls "left, right, bottom, top."

2003-02-28  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* roper_server.h : Makes it possible to access the buffer holding the
		image directly for faster access.
	* stack_collector.cpp : Provides an image preview window.  Debugged,
		but the final bug fix has not yet been tested (when the
		image is a subset of the whole possible image in X).
	* stack_collector.dsp : Same.

2002-11-24  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* argonot.cpp : Modified to use new vrpn_TempImager class.
	* directx_camera_server.cpp : Same.  This involved removing a lot
		of code, which is now down inside the TempImager.
		Also inserted sleep to try and make it not eat the CPU.
	* directx_camera_server.h : Same.
	* roper_server.cpp : Making use the new vrpn_TempImager class.
		Not tested.
	* stack_collector.dsp : Enable building release version.
	* test_driectx_library.dsp : Same.
	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : Works with new vrpn_TempImager class.
	* video_tempimager_server.cpp : Same.  Took out unused code.

2002-11-14  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* argonot.cpp : Increased sleep from 1 to 5 ms to increase read rate.
	* directx_camera_server.cpp : Uses a pair of buffers for the normal
		and inverted-in-y video that are swapped each time, rather
		than allocated a new buffer each time a frame needs to be
		swapped.  Twiddled with some loop code to move calculations
		outside the loops and use adds rather than multiplies within
		the loops.

2002-11-05  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* argonot.cpp : Option to let the user clear the background.
	* directx_camera_server.cpp : Enables setting the video resolution.
		Prints timing information (frames/second read).
	* directx_camera_server.h : Same.
	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : Enabled hard-coding video resolution.
		It was slow when set to 640x480, so I put it back to 320x240
		until I can figure out why.
	* video_tempimager_server.cpp : Enabled setting the video resolution
		for DirectX cameras on the command line.

2002-11-04  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* argonot.cpp : Modified the gain and offset settings to be clamp
		values (matches the way the Argus system works).
		Added command-line argument to tell which device to
		connect to (default is at localhost).

2002-11-04  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* directx_camera_server.cpp : Changing buffers from signed to
		unsigned characters to avoid sign-extension before
		sending as 16-bit values.
	* directx_camera_server.h : Same.
	* directx_videofile_server.cpp : Same.
	* video.dsw : Adding argonot program to the file.
	* argonot.cpp : Program to enable gain and contrast adjustments to
		received video images and enable background subtraction of
		the initial image (or subtraction such that the initial image
		becomes 128 everywhere).

2002-10-27  Charalampos Fretzagias <fretzagi@cs.unc.edu>

	* base_camera_server.h : Added send_vrpn_image. This makes
		base_camera_server depend on vrpn, but does wonders for
		the speed of the server. Also removed allocation of
		memory while in the mainloop of the server; all memory
		needed is allocated just once and reused until camera
		objects are destrocted.
	* directx_camera_server.h : Same as above.
	* roper_server.h : Same as above.
	* directx_camera_server.cpp : implementation of send_vrpn_image
	* roper_server.cpp : implementation of send_vrpn_image
	* video_tempimager_server.cpp : replaced the calls to the two
		mainloop functions with a call to send_vrpn_image in the
		mainloop of the server.

2002-10-27  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* base_camera_server.h : White space adjust.
	* roper_server.cpp : Added code to read from the Roper in continuous
		mode rather than one frame at a time; this code doesn't work
		(and neither does the example code on which it is based, it
		turns out), so this is not yet enabled.  Also optimized to
		only do open/close code at the beginning and end, not every
		frame (which sped it up marginally).
	* roper_server.h : Same.
	* roper_example.cpp : Test program from Roper manual (turns out not
		to work!)
	* roper_example.dsp : Build file for this.
	* video.dsw : Added a Roper test program.
	* video_tempimager_server.cpp : Added comments.  Changed white space.
		Moved signal handler installation to another location.

2002-10-23  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* directx_camera_server.cpp : Swap Red and Blue to the correct order.

2002-10-14  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* base_camera_server.h : Added concept of binning.
				 Changed coordinates to unsigned from int.
				 Removed un-needed function prototypes.
	* directx_camera_server.cpp : Added debugging information.
				      Added check and new print for failure.
				      Clarified that exposure is in milliseconds.
				      Changed ints to unsigneds for coordinates.
	* directx_videofile_server.cpp : Added the filter graph to the object
		table so that DirectX graph editor can edit it.  Helpful when
		debugging failure to play some video files.  Still debugging
		that...  Trying to do single-step through video files, but can't
		get interface (other example code can...)
	* roper_server.cpp : Added support for binning.
	* video_tempimager_server.cpp : Added command-line options for exposure
		and binning, and which camera to use.

2002-10-11  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* roper_server.cpp : Changes to make it work now that it is derived from
		the base camera class.
	* roper_server.h : Same.
	* video_spot_tracker.cpp : Extra debugging print.
	* video_tempimager_server.cpp : Can tell which of several cameras of the
		same type you want to start.  On the command line, you tell it
		the type of device and which to use.

2002-10-10  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

        * base_camera_server.h : Adds parameter to PPM write for 16-bit files.
        * directx_camera_server.cpp : Adds 16-bit PPM write.
                Adds the ability to pause the video (mostly for use by the derived
                class that reads from stored video files).
        * directx_camera_server.h : Same.
        * directx_videofile_server.cpp : Trying to make it work better.  It still
                skips to the end of the file when you pause.  Some streams still
                don't play past the first frame.
        * directx_videofile_server.h : Adds controls for play, rewind, pause.
        * roper_server.cpp : Adds 16-bit write for PPM files.
                Renames parameter to make sure milliseconds is explicit.
        * roper_server.h : Same.
        * spot_tracker.cpp : Adds routine to optimize in X,Y but not radius.
        * spot_tracker.h : Same.
        * stack_collector.cpp : Adds "Sixteen bits" button for image collection.
                Stops the stack in the middle if "snap" unchecked or "quit".
        * video_spot_tracker.cpp : 
                Adds play/rewind buttons for when open a video file.
        * test_directx_library.cpp : New constructor parameter.
        * video_tempimager_server.cpp : New constructor parameter.

2002-09-13  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>
