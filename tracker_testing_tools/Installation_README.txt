	This installation includes a number of utilities that are used by scripts to generate test images and test the video spot tracker program.  They are all installed in the same directory to make it easier for the scripts to find them.
	The programs included in this installation are:

	add_noise_to_image.exe
	compare_tracking_files.exe
	make_moving_spot_video.exe	

Note:
	The noise-generation program uses the GPL-licensed STOCC random-number library to generate the noise found in the image.  Thus, Airy Disk Creator is also released under the GPL.
