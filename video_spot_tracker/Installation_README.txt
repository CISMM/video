Notes:
	The video spot tracker program requires DirectX version 9.0a.  It requires the camera drivers for any attached Roper or SPOT camera to be installed.
	For the video spot tracker programs to work correctly, you must also install the NSRG Runtime Environment, which is a large download that includes all of the DLLs and other files needed to run applications from the NSRG.  It installs itself in C:\NSRG\external\pc_win32.
	This program is supplied AS IT, without any express or implied warranty of effectiveness or usefulness for any purpose.  Version 01.21 of the program has undergone only ad-hoc testing for accuracy.  You've been warned.
