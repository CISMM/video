Note:
	The Video project uses CMake to construct its build files.  Version 3.0 or higher will need to be installed along with a platform-specific compiler chain.
	For a minimal build of the spot-tracker library and some applications, use the minimal_build.sh script.  It will install VRPN in /usr/local/ and when will build the video targets in ~/deleteme/build/video.  It has the side effect of re-checkout-out the video project in ~/deleteme, so it is not an optimal build script for production use.
	For the stack collector and video spot tracker programs to have all expected CISMM cameras, you must also install the NSRG Runtime Environment, which is a large download that includes all of the DLLs and other files needed to run applications from the NSRG.  It installs itself in C:\NSRG\external\pc_win32.
