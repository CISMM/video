<title>CISMM Video Optimizer v01.02</title>











<h1>CISMM Video Optimizer v01.02</h1>











<p>The <dfn>CISMM Video Optimizer</dfn> program is used to optimize video frames 


  from a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/directx">Microsoft DirectShow</a>-compatible 


  video file, from a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/directx">Microsoft DirectShow</a>-compatible 


  camera, from a <a href="http://roperscientific.com">Roper Scientific</a> camera, 


  from a <a href="http://diaginc.com">DiagInc</a> SPOT camera, or from a set of 


  TIFF or BMP files (it can read other, compressed file formats but these are 


  not included in the default set because these file formats distort images in 


  ways that affect tracking accuracy). The program currently runs only on Windows, 


  but it uses the portable openGL library for rendering, the portable Tcl/Tk for 


  user interface control, and the portable ImageMagick package for reading images.</p>


<p>The first (so far the only) function of the program is to remove shifts between 
  frames in the images. It provides one or two optimizable fiducial marks that 
  can be placed on the same image feature in each frame of the video. The video 
  is resampled to keep these points stable in the output log, which is a set of 
  TIFF files that have the video stabilized.</p>


<p>Planned features include setting a subregion of the video to store, contrast/gain 


  adjustment, and removal of imaging artifacts.</p>











<h2>Running the program</h2>











<p>The program is run by dragging a video file or image file onto the desktop 


  icon that was created when the program was installed. To select a stack of image 


  files that are numbered consecutively, drag any one of the files onto the icon. 


  It can also be run by selecting one of the camera-specific shortcuts from <i><b>Start 


  Menu/All Programs/NSRG/CISMM Video Optimizer v01.02</b></i>. If you run the 


  program directly by double-clicking on the icon, it will ask for a video or 


  image file (AVI, TIF, or BMP) that it should open.</p>











<h2><img src="GUI.jpg" width="170" height="566" align="right">Using the program</h2>











<p>When the program is run and a file is selected, four windows will appear. The 





  image window that appears on the lower right contains the first image within 





  the video file or a continually-updating image from a live camera feed. The 





  control panel named <b><i>tk</i></b> that appears on the left when the program 





  is run (shown here to the right) contains a number of interaction widgets that 





  control the operation of the program. The <b><i>kernel</i></b> control panel 





  that appears above the image window (described later) controls the type of tracking 





  kernel being used. The <b><i>log</i></b> control panel is described later.</p>











<h3>Selecting the color channel to use</h3>











<p><img src="red_green_blue.jpg" width="156" height="60" align="left">If the video 











  file (or video camera) contains different data sets in the red, green, and blue 











  channels then you will need to select the one you want to view. By default, 











  the red channel (channel 0) is selected. To select a different channel, click 











  on the &quot;0&quot; beneath the <i><b>red_green_blue </b></i>slider and type 











  its number into the dialog box that appears. Enter 1 for green and 2 for blue. 











  The video window should change to display the selected channel.</p>











<h3>Selecting the Image bit depth</h3>











<p>A <i>bit</i> is a computer term for an entity that can take on two values, 


  stored as zero and one. Using several bits in parallel enables the encoding 


  of integers: binary notations is like decimal notation but each digit can only 


  have the value zero or one before wrapping around. Counting proceeds as follows: 


  000, 001, 010, 011, 100 corresponds to decimal 0,1,2,3,4. Stacking 8 bits together 


  (a bit depth of 8) covers the range 0-255. Stacking 12 bits covers the range 


  0-4095. The default bit depth in <i>CISMM Video Optimizer </i> is 8 bits per 


  pixel. This is correct for AVI files and many common file formats. Most scientific 


  cameras, however, operate at 12 bits per pixel. When such an image is loaded 


  into CISMM Video Optimizer, it produces a strange-looking image with dark spots 


  where there should be bright spots, or bands of dark and light. While this will 


  not interfere with the tracking (it is only a problem of mapping 12 bits of 


  color to 8 bits of displayable color on the screen), it looks unappealing. By 


  adjusting the bit depth to exceed the number of bits that are used in the image, 


  these colors can be brought into range. If you load a 16-bit image, this can 


  be handled by clicking on the number below the slider and typing in 16; even 


  though it exceeds the maximum slider value, it can be set in this manner. To 


  repeat, <b><i>this setting has no effect on tracking, only on the images shown 


  on the screen</i></b>.</p>











<h3>Selecting the type of optimization</h3>
<p>By default, the CISMM Video Optimizer only applies a translation to successive 
  frames in the image and only provides one fiducial mark, which follows a point 
  on the images that is to remain fixed in the output video.</p>
<p>If either or both of the <cite>reorient</cite> and <cite>rescale</cite> check-boxes 
  in the Tcl menu are checked, a second fiducial mark appears. This mark is to 
  be placed on a second point in each image that is to be kept at the same relative 
  location compared to the (moving) first point. If reorient is selected, the 
  images are rotated in-plane so that it points in always lies in the same direction 
  from the first fiducial. If rescale is selected, the images are uniformly scaled 
  so that it always lies at the same distance from the (moving) first point.</p>
<h3>Moving the fiducial marks</h3>











<p>To select the fiducial feature in the first image, click on its center with 
  the left mouse button. A red plus sign will move to the location you have selected. 
  If you want to adjust its radius, click on the number beneath the <i><b>radius</b></i> 
  slider within the <b><i>kernel</i></b> control panel and enter it into the dialog 
  box that appears or by move the <b><i>radius</i></b> slider. When there are 
  two fiducials shown, the nearest one will move to the location where the mouse 
  button is pressed.</p>











<p>Note that when optimization is turned on, the tracker will always jump to the 


  optimum location nearest the current location of the mouse cursor.</p>











<p>If you prefer to not have the centers of the tracked objects obscured by the 


  tracking markers, select the <b><i>round_cursor</i></b> checkbox from the <b><i>tk</i></b> 


  control panel. This will replace the plus signs with a circle around the center 


  at twice the radius that the kernel is set to use.</p>











<h3>Selecting the type of tracker</h3>











<p><img src="kernel.jpg" width="528" height="117"></p>











<p>There are three types of tracking kernels available in version 1.02, disc, 


  cone, and symmetric. Their properties are controlled using interface widgets 


  in the <cite>kernel</cite> control panel.</p>





<p>For tracking spots that are even in intensity, or which have uneven intensities 





  within them but a defined circular edge, the <cite><strong>disc</strong></cite> 





  kernel should be used. The radius should be set to match the radius of the spots 





  you wish to track. The <cite><strong>interpolate</strong></cite> checkbox should 





  be set for more accuracy and cleared for more speed.</p>





<p>For tracking spots that are brighter in the center and drop off to dim (or 





  darkest in the center and ramp up to bright), the <cite><strong>cone</strong></cite> 





  kernel should be used. For cone tracking, the radius should be set about 1/3 





  larger than the spots you want to track (giving the kernel a good sampling of 





  the background as well as the spot). The setting of the <cite>interpolate</cite> 





  check box does not matter for the cone tracker (this tracker always interpolates).</p>





<p></p>





<p>A parameter relevant for both the disc and cone kernel is whether the spots 





  are dark points in a lighter background (the default) or lighter points in a 





  dark background). This is controlled using the <dfn><strong>dark_spot</strong></dfn> 





  check box located at the top of the user interface. You should set this for 





  the type of spot you are seeking.</p>











<p>If the bead profile is changing over time, or if it does not fit well into 


  one of the above categories, then the <cite><strong>symmetric</strong></cite> 


  tracker should be chosen. This tracker operates by locating the minimum variance 


  in concentric rings around the bead center. It sums the variance in circles 


  of radius 1, 2, 3, ... up to the radius setting and divides each circle's radius 


  by its circumference to provide even weights for each ring. The radius should 


  be set to be at least slighly larger than the bead that is to be tracked; setting 


  it larger will not harm tracking except to make the program run more slowly. 


  The setting on the <cite>dark_spot</cite> check box has no effect when symmetric 


  tracker is chosen.</p>











<h3>Enabling the fiducial to follow jumps in bead position</h3>





<p></p>





<p>The <strong><cite>follow_jumps</cite></strong> check-box activates a more-robust 





  tracking algorithm that first looks for the best image match within 2 radiii 





  of the prior position and then performs the standard kernel match. This makes 





  the tracking run more slowly, but is more robust to bead motion between frames. 





  It does not affect the accuracy or the style of the main optimization for the 





  kernel, it is only used to initialize the new search location between frames.</p>





<h3>Activating the fiducial tracker</h3>











<p></p>











<p>Once you have selected the type of tracker to use, and have selected the fiducial 


  track, you can check the <cite>optimize</cite> checkbox. When you do this, the 


  fiducial will move to the centers of the spots it was started on. You do not 


  have to turn on this optimization for the offset to work; if you select a fiducial 


  that is not a spot, you should not turn it on. You should then move the fiducial 


  mark to its new location after single-stepping through each video frame.</p>











<h3>Reading the position of the fiducial</h3>











<p>The location of the fiducial mark is shown in the <b><i>x</i></b>, <b><i>y</i></b>, 


  and <b><i>radius</i></b> displays in the kernel window. Note that these may 


  show subpixel positions and radii. You can control the minimum step size that 


  the optimizer will use by adjusting the <b><i>precision</i></b> slider within 


  the <b><i>tk</i></b> control panel. Smaller values make the program run more 


  slowly but will result in the program attempting to find the position with greater 


  precision (this will not necessarily correspond to greater accuracy, due to 


  noise and possibly aliasing).</p>











<h3>Saving the optimized video</h3>











<p><img src="log.jpg" width="201" height="61" align="right">You can record the 


  motion of the trackers by checking the <b><i>Logging</i></b> checkbox within 


  the <b><i>log</i></b> control panel (shown to the right). This will bring up 


  a dialog box that will let you select a filename. Once you have selected a file 


  name, you check the <b><i>play_video</i></b> checkbox to begin going through 


  the video file, or you can use the <b><i>single_step_video</i></b> repeatedly 


  to step through a frame at a time. When you are finished with the section of 


  tracking that you are interested in, uncheck the Logging checkbox to stop the 


  logging. You can then go forward to another section, turn on logging, and save 


  a different file sequence if you like. The files that are stored will have the 


  format: <dfn>filename</dfn>.opt.<dfn>nnnn</dfn>.tif, where filename is the name 


  selected above, and nnnn is replaced by the frame number from the video (starts 


  at frame 0 and goes up by one for each single_step).</p>











<p>Logging will not occur while the file is paused, or when the end of the video 


  has been reached (the last frame is stored either when you quit the program 


  or when you stop logging). This is done so that you can place the trackers back 


  onto spots that have jumped too far between frames when single-stepping through 


  the video and still get an accurate record of where the spots went. There will 


  be one file per frame of video stepped through or played through. <b><i>Note</i></b>: 


  Some video files have a 30 frame/second playback but have three copies of the 


  same video frame to produce an overall update of 10 frames/second; this will 


  produce repeated location reports for each of the identical frames.</p>











<h3>Controlling playback</h3>











<p>Whether logging is turned on or not (for previewing to see how well the fiducial 


  mark tracks, for instance), the video can be played by checking the <b><i>play_video</i></b> 


  checkbox, and paused by unchecking it. The <b><i>single_step_video</i></b> checkbox 


  will step forwards one video frame each time it is pressed. The <b><i>rewind</i></b> 


  checkbox causes the video to rewind to the beginning, play the first frame of 


  the video, and then pause. The <cite>FrameNum</cite> display shows which frame 


  of a video file is currently being displayed.</p>
