<title>CISMM Video Optimizer v01.13</title>

<h1>CISMM Video Optimizer v01.13</h1>

<p>The <dfn>CISMM Video Optimizer</dfn> program is used to optimize video frames from a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/directx">Microsoft DirectShow</a>-compatible video file, from a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/directx">Microsoft DirectShow</a>-compatible camera, from a <a href="http://roperscientific.com">Roper Scientific</a> camera, from a <a href="http://diaginc.com">DiagInc</a> SPOT camera, or from a set of TIFF or BMP files (it can read other, compressed file formats but these are not included in the default set because these file formats distort images in ways that affect tracking accuracy). The program currently runs only on Windows, but it uses the portable openGL library for rendering, the portable Tcl/Tk for user interface control, and the portable ImageMagick package for reading images.</p>

<p>The program can:</p>
<ol>
  <li> Remove shifts between frames in the images. It provides one or two optimizable 
    fiducial marks that can be placed on the same image feature in each frame 
    of the video. The video is resampled to keep these points stable in the output 
    log, which is a set of TIFF files that have the video stabilized.</li>
  <li>Select a subset of the video region to store in the output.</li>
  <li>Adjust contrast and gain of the video.</li>
  <li>Subtract out a mean image, mininimum image, or maximum image from the video.</li>
</ol>
<p>Planned features include speed improvement, and removal of imaging artifacts.</p>

<h2>Thank-You Ware</h2>
<p>This program is distributed as &quot;Thank-You Ware.&quot; As a National Research 
  Resource, we are funded by the NIH National Institute of Biomedical Imaging 
  and Bioengineering to develop tools for scientists. Part of our mission is to 
  distribute these tools broadly to help biomedical researchers do their work.</p>
<p>Rather than making you register to download our software or join a mailing 
  list or provide other personally-identifying material to use our code, we've 
  come up with the following easy and anonymous way for you to let us know we're 
  helping the community. When you press the &quot;Say Thank You!&quot; button 
  to let us know you appreciate having the tool, the application sends a web query 
  to our server and logs your response (not your name or your phone number, just 
  a web hit count). We add up these counts and report them to the reviewers for 
  our renewal applications when we ask NIBIB to continue funding us to maintain 
  our existing tools and to build new ones. Please press the button whenever you 
  feel like the tool has been helpful to you.</p>
<h2>Running the program</h2>

<p>The program is run by dragging a video file or image file onto the desktop 
  icon that was created when the program was installed. To select a stack of image 
  files that are numbered consecutively, drag any one of the files onto the icon. 
  It can also be run by selecting one of the camera-specific shortcuts from <i><b>Start 
  Menu/All Programs/NSRG/CISMM Video Optimizer v01.13</b></i>. If you run the 
  program directly by double-clicking on the icon, it will ask for a video or 
  image file (AVI, TIF, or BMP) that it should open.</p> 

<h2><img src="GUI.jpg" width="173" height="733" align="right">Using the program</h2>

<p>When the program is run and a file is selected, four windows will appear. The image window that appears on the lower right contains the first image within the video file or a continually-updating image from a live camera feed. The control panel named <b><i>tk</i></b> that appears on the left when the program is run (shown here to the right) contains a number of interaction widgets that control the operation of the program. The <b><i>kernel</i></b> control panel that appears above the image window (described later) controls the type of tracking kernel being used. The <b><i>log</i></b> control panel is described later.</p> 

<h3>Selecting the color channel to use</h3>

<p>If the video file (or video camera) contains different data sets in the red, 
  green, and blue channels then you will need to select the one you want to view. 
  By default, the red channel <i><b>R</b></i> is selected. To select a different 
  channel, click on <i><b>G</b></i> for green or <i><b>B</b></i> for blue. The 
  video window should change to display the selected channel.</p> 

<h3>Selecting the image bit depth</h3>

<p>A <i>bit</i> is a computer term for an entity that can take on two values, 
  stored as zero and one. Using several bits in parallel enables the encoding 
  of integers: binary notations is like decimal notation but each digit can only 
  have the value zero or one before wrapping around. Counting proceeds as follows: 
  000, 001, 010, 011, 100 corresponds to decimal 0,1,2,3,4. Stacking 8 bits together 
  (a bit depth of 8) covers the range 0-255. Stacking 12 bits covers the range 
  0-4095. The default bit depth in <i>CISMM Video Optimizer </i> is 8 bits per 
  pixel. This is correct for AVI files and many common file formats. Most scientific 
  cameras, however, operate at 12 bits per pixel. When such an image is loaded 
  into CISMM Video Optimizer, it produces a strange-looking image with dark spots 
  where there should be bright spots, or bands of dark and light. While this will 
  not interfere with the tracking (it is only a problem of mapping 12 bits of 
  color to 8 bits of displayable color on the screen), it looks unappealing. By 
  adjusting the bit depth to exceed the number of bits that are used in the image, 
  these colors can be brought into range. If you load a 16-bit image, this can 
  be handled by clicking on the number below the slider and typing in 16; even 
  though it exceeds the maximum slider value, it can be set in this manner. To 
  repeat, <b><i>this setting has no effect on tracking, only on the images shown 
  on the screen</i></b>. It also has no effect on the high-value cropping within 
  16-bit stored files: the screen only shows 8 bits, but if an image is saved 
  as 16 bits then the data values above the high-crop line (see below) and the 
  maximum stored value will be maintained in the stored file. It does affect the 
  brightness in 8-bit stored files.</p>

<h3>Adjusting contrast and brightness</h3>
<p><img src="gain_controls.jpg" width="326" height="99" align="right">The brightness 
  and contrast of the image can be adjusted using the gain control panel, which 
  is displayed when the <i>show_gain_control</i> box is checked; this box is off 
  by default. The control panel is shown to the right. The two sliders are used 
  to bracket the range of brightness that is to be stored in the output file. 
  By default, they cover the entire normalized range (0 to 1). The actual pixel-value 
  range is determined by the setting of the <i>bit_depth</i> slider in the main 
  control panel: 8 bits means values from 0-255 are the full range, while 12 bits 
  means 0-4095. Every intensity below the <i>clip_low</i> setting is set to zero, 
  every pixel above the <i>clip_high</i> value is set to maximum, and the intensities 
  in between are stretched to cover the range represented by <i>bit_depth</i>. 
  Note that if the output file is 8 bits, then it will contain the same values 
  shown on the screen. If it is 16 bits, then the high-value cropping may not 
  occur because there are more representable values in the file than can be shown 
  on the screen; in this case, the stretching will still occur but the high values 
  will still be present in the output file.</p>
<p>The <i>auto</i> check-box will cause the program to adjust the clipping values 
  to bracket the actual intensity values found in the section of the file that 
  is to be stored. This will automatically make the intensity span the available 
  range for display, mapping all available colors to the display.</p>
<p>The red, green, and blue channels of the input image are scaled using the same 
  settings.</p>
<p><b>Note: </b> Adjusting the clipping values will produce variable gains in 
  the intensity in the output file, relative to the actual intensities present 
  in the input file. It should not be used if quantitative pixel values are required.</p>
<h3>Cropping the video</h3>

<p><img src="crop.jpg" width="168" height="154" align="right">To reduce the size of the resulting image stack, it is possible the select only a sub-region of the video that is to be saved, cropping the video to the selected region. The region can be selected in one of two ways. The first is to press and hold the right mouse button at the center of the desired region and then drag the mouse to set one corner of the region. The second is to select the <cite>show_clipping</cite> checkbox in the <cite>tk</cite> control panel. This will bring up a new control window that lets you slide the four sides of the selection region within the image.</p>

<p>Whichever cropping method is used, a set of green lines will outline the region of video that is to be saved. If one of the lines is past the edge of the video frame, it will not appear. As new image features enter the frame (during playback), their pixels will appear in the final video. Anything past the edge of the video will appear as a black region surrounding the actual video.</p>

<p>Remember that objects will move as the video goes, so be careful to preview your video and make sure everything stays in the cropped region for the segment of video you are optimizing, with room to spare for any border around objects that you need.</p>

<h3>Performing image operations</h3>
<p><img src="imagemix_controls.jpg" width="377" height="169" align="right">When 
  the <i>show_imagemix_control</i> check-box is checked, the <i>imagemix</i> control 
  panel appears. This enables the calculation of min, max, and mean images, which 
  are per-pixel operations on all images seen while the <i>accumulate</i> check-boxes 
  are turned on. A set of radio buttons on the left displays these statistical 
  images, and by default shows the computed image.</p>
<p>The computed image can either be the standard image as described above (when 
  <i>subract_none</i> is) chosen in the central radio list or an image computed 
  by subtracting one of the min, max, or mean images. It is also possible to subtract 
  a single image from later images; when <i>subtract_single</i> is checked, the 
  image will go grey (subtracted from itself) and later images will show the difference 
  between the original image and the current image.</p>
<h3>Spatially transforming the image</h3>

<p>By default, the CISMM Video Optimizer only applies a translation to successive frames in the image and only provides one fiducial mark, which follows a point on the images that is to remain fixed in the output video.</p>

<p>If either or both of the <cite>reorient</cite> and <cite>rescale</cite> check-boxes in the Tcl menu are checked, a second fiducial mark appears. This mark is to be placed on a second point in each image that is to be kept at the same relative location compared to the (moving) first point. If reorient is selected, the images are rotated in-plane so that it points in always lies in the same direction from the first fiducial. If rescale is selected, the images are uniformly scaled so that it always lies at the same distance from the (moving) first point.</p>

<h3>Moving the fiducial marks</h3>

<p>To select the fiducial feature in the first image, click on its center with the left mouse button. A red plus sign will move to the location you have selected.  If you want to adjust its radius, click on the number beneath the <i><b>radius</b></i> slider within the <b><i>kernel</i></b> control panel and enter it into the dialog box that appears or by move the <b><i>radius</i></b> slider. When there are two fiducials shown, the nearest one will move to the location where the mouse button is pressed.</p> 

<p>Note that when optimization is turned on, the tracker will always jump to the optimum location nearest the current location of the mouse cursor.</p> 

<p>If you prefer to not have the centers of the tracked objects obscured by the tracking markers, select the <b><i>round_cursor</i></b> checkbox from the <b><i>tk</i></b> control panel. This will replace the plus signs with a circle around the center at twice the radius that the kernel is set to use.</p> 

<h3>Selecting the type of tracker</h3>

<p><img src="kernel.jpg" width="528" height="117"></p>

<p>There are three types of tracking kernels available in version 1.10, disc, 
  cone, and symmetric. Their properties are controlled using interface widgets 
  in the <cite>kernel</cite> control panel.</p> 

<p>For tracking spots that are even in intensity, or which have uneven intensities within them but a defined circular edge, the <cite><strong>disc</strong></cite> kernel should be used. The radius should be set to match the radius of the spots you wish to track. The <cite><strong>interpolate</strong></cite> checkbox should be set for more accuracy and cleared for more speed.</p> 

<p>For tracking spots that are brighter in the center and drop off to dim (or darkest in the center and ramp up to bright), the <cite><strong>cone</strong></cite> kernel should be used. For cone tracking, the radius should be set about 1/3 larger than the spots you want to track (giving the kernel a good sampling of the background as well as the spot). The setting of the <cite>interpolate</cite> check box does not matter for the cone tracker (this tracker always interpolates).</p> 

<p>A parameter relevant for both the disc and cone kernel is whether the spots are dark points in a lighter background (the default) or lighter points in a dark background). This is controlled using the <dfn><strong>dark_spot</strong></dfn> check box located at the top of the user interface. You should set this for the type of spot you are seeking.</p> 

<p>If the bead profile is changing over time, or if it does not fit well into one of the above categories, then the <cite><strong>symmetric</strong></cite> tracker should be chosen. This tracker operates by locating the minimum variance in concentric rings around the bead center. It sums the variance in circles of radius 1, 2, 3, ... up to the radius setting and divides each circle's radius by its circumference to provide even weights for each ring. The radius should be set to be at least slighly larger than the bead that is to be tracked; setting it larger will not harm tracking except to make the program run more slowly.  The setting on the <cite>dark_spot</cite> check box has no effect when symmetric tracker is chosen.</p> 

<h3>Enabling the fiducial to follow jumps in bead position</h3>

<p>The <strong><cite>follow_jumps</cite></strong> check-box activates a more-robust tracking algorithm that first looks for the best image match within 2 radiii of the prior position and then performs the standard kernel match. This makes the tracking run more slowly, but is more robust to bead motion between frames.  It does not affect the accuracy or the style of the main optimization for the kernel, it is only used to initialize the new search location between frames.</p> 

<h3>Activating the fiducial tracker</h3>

<p>Once you have selected the type of tracker to use, and have selected the fiducial track, you can check the <cite>optimize</cite> checkbox. When you do this, the fiducial will move to the centers of the spots it was started on. You do not have to turn on this optimization for the offset to work; if you select a fiducial that is not a spot, you should not turn it on. You should then move the fiducial mark to its new location after single-stepping through each video frame.</p> 

<h3>Reading the position of the fiducial</h3>

<p>The location of the fiducial mark is shown in the <b><i>x</i></b>, <b><i>y</i></b>, and <b><i>radius</i></b> displays in the kernel window. Note that these may show subpixel positions and radii. You can control the minimum step size that the optimizer will use by adjusting the <b><i>precision</i></b> slider within the <b><i>tk</i></b> control panel. Smaller values make the program run more slowly but will result in the program attempting to find the position with greater precision (this will not necessarily correspond to greater accuracy, due to noise and possibly aliasing).</p> 

<h3>Saving the optimized video</h3>

<p><img src="log.jpg" width="494" height="61" align="right">You can record the 
  motion of the trackers by checking the <b><i>Logging</i></b> checkbox within 
  the <b><i>log</i></b> control panel (shown to the right). This will bring up 
  a dialog box that will let you select a filename. Once you have selected a file 
  name, you check the <b><i>play_video</i></b> checkbox to begin going through 
  the video file, or you can use the <b><i>single_step_video</i></b> repeatedly 
  to step through a frame at a time. When you are finished with the section of 
  tracking that you are interested in, uncheck the Logging checkbox to stop the 
  logging. You can then go forward to another section, turn on logging, and save 
  a different file sequence if you like. The files that are stored will have the 
  format: <dfn>filename</dfn>.opt.<dfn>nnnn</dfn>.tif, where filename is the name 
  selected above, and nnnn is replaced by the frame number from the video (starts 
  at frame 0 and goes up by one for each single_step).</p> 

<p>Logging will not occur while the file is paused, or when the end of the video has been reached (the last frame is stored either when you quit the program or when you stop logging). This is done so that you can place the trackers back onto spots that have jumped too far between frames when single-stepping through the video and still get an accurate record of where the spots went. There will be one file per frame of video stepped through or played through. <b><i>Note</i></b>: Some video files have a 30 frame/second playback but have three copies of the same video frame to produce an overall update of 10 frames/second; this will produce repeated location reports for each of the identical frames.</p> 
<p>CISMM Video Optimizer saves 16-bit files by default. You can switch this to 
  8-bit files (which have less information but can be read by a wider variety 
  of programs) by un-checking hte <cite>Log 16 bits</cite> checkbox.</p>
<p>CISMM Video Optimizer saves all three color channels (red, green, and blue) 
  by default, but if only one channel is of interest (or for monochrome images), 
  checking the <i>Monochrome</i> box will save grayscale images, which will be 
  1/3 the size on disk of color images.</p>
<p><b>Logging a spread function:</b> It is possible to log the &quot;spread function&quot; 
  of points, beads, or other objects in the video. This is done by checking the 
  <b><i>Log Point-spread</i></b> box before turning on logging. If selected, the 
  program will acquire data centered on the first tracker (number zero), whose 
  radius is the same as the tracker radius. The spread function file is a radial 
  average around the center (providing one line of the image for each video frame). 
  The file will have the same name base name as the standard TIFF files, but the 
  suffix &quot;.psf.tif&quot; and it will contain one line for each frame of the 
  video that is optimized, with the first line at bottom of the image and the 
  last line at the top. It can be used by the <i>Video Spot Tracker</i> program 
  to estimate the Z location of beads or other radially-symmetric features in 
  images.</p> 

<h3>Controlling playback</h3> 

<p>Whether logging is turned on or not (for previewing to see how well the fiducial mark tracks, for instance), the video can be played by checking the <b><i>play_video</i></b> checkbox, and paused by unchecking it. The <b><i>single_step_video</i></b> checkbox will step forwards one video frame each time it is pressed. The <b><i>rewind</i></b> checkbox causes the video to rewind to the beginning, play the first frame of the video, and then pause. The <cite>FrameNum</cite> display shows which frame of a video file is currently being displayed.</p>

  </ul>
<h3>Version 01.12</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed a bug in saving when auto-gain is turned on. The previous version
