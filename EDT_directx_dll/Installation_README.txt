Note:
	For the DirectShow driver to work properly, DirectX 9.0b must be installed on the machine that it is to run on.  For the viewing and saving applications to work correctly, GraphEdit must be installed (this can be found in the DirectX Software Developers' Kit [SDK]).  These can both be found at www.microsoft.com/directx.
	The EDT configuration program must have been run to set the camera that is being used before this program is run.
