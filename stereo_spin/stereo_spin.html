<title>Stereo Spin V01.00</title>

<h1>Stereo Spin version 01.00</h1>

<p>The <i><b>Stereo Spin </b></i> program is used to display stereo images from 
  a spinning video from a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/directx">Microsoft 
  DirectShow</a>-compatible video file or from a set of TIFF, PPM, PGM, BMP files. 
  It can also read raw, uncompressed 8-bit video files. The program currently 
  runs only on Windows, but it uses the portable openGL library for rendering, 
  the portable Tcl/Tk for user interface control, and the portable <a href="http://www.imagemagic.org">ImageMagick</a> 
  package for reading images.</p>

<h2>Downloading and installing the program</h2>
<p>An installer for the program and manual can be downloaded from the <a href="http://www.cs.unc.edu/Research/nano/cismm/download/index.html">CISMM 
  software download page</a>. It requires <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/directx">Microsoft 
  <i>Direct X</i></a> version 9.0a or higher to be able to read movie files on 
  Windows.</p>
<p>The program installs itself by default into <i>C:\Program Files\CISMM</i>, 
  and puts its running shortcuts into <i><b>Start Menu/All Programs/CISMM/Stereo 
  Spin</b></i>.</p>
<h2>Cost of Use</h2>
<p>The development, dissemination, and support of this program is paid for by 
  the National Institutes of Health <a href="http://www.nibib.nih.gov/">National 
  Institute for Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering</a> through its National 
  Research Resource in <a href="http://www.cs.unc.edu/nano/cismm">Computer-Integrated 
  Systems for Microscopy and Manipulation</a> at the University of North Carolina 
  at Chapel Hill. This program is distributed without charge, subject to the following 
  terms: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Acknowledgement in any publication, written, videotaped, or otherwise produced, 
    that results from using this program. The acknowledgement should credit: CISMM 
    at UNC-CH, supported by the NIH NIBIB (NIH 5-P41-RR02170).</li>
  <li>Furnish a reference to (and preferably a copy of) any publication, including 
    videotape, that you produce and disseminate outside your group using our program. 
    These should be addressed to: taylorr@cs.unc.edu; Russell M. Taylor II, Department 
    of Computer Science, Sitterson Hall,University of North Carolina at Chapel 
    Hill, Chapel Hill, NC 27599-3175.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Running the program</h2>

<p>The program is run by dragging a video file or image file onto the desktop 
  icon that was created when the program was installed. To select a stack of image 
  files that are numbered consecutively, drag any one of the files onto the icon. 
  It can also be run by selecting it from <i><b>Start Menu/All Programs/CISMM/Stereo 
  Spin</b></i>. If you run the program directly by double-clicking on the icon, 
  it will ask for a video or image file (AVI, TIF, or BMP, PPM, raw) that it should 
  open.</p>
<h3>Required Hardware and drivers</h3>
<p> <i>Stereo Spin</i> uses OpenGL stereo, and requires a video card and driver 
  set that supports this. For <i>nVidia</i> graphics, this requires a Quadro-type 
  card with an external stereo-sync connector to work with the glasses (the DirectX/GeForce 
  game-type stereo does not work with this program). For other manufacturers, 
  check their specifications and drivers to ensure that they support OpenGL stereo.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Required Video Formats</h3>
<p>This program assumes that the video file being read in is a 360-degree spinning-viewpoint 
  movie, where there is an even separation in angles between frames in the movie. 
  The last frame in the movie <i>should not</i> be the same as the first frame, 
  but rather should have the same angle separation from the first frame as each 
  frame in the movie has from its neighbor. The separation between frames does 
  not have to be 1 degree, so long as it is the same between each frame; thus 
  the number of frames does not have to be 360. Movies that play as a continuous 
  spinning loop without jerkiness when shown in a repeating mode in a media browser 
  should work fine.</p>
<p>The rotational-movie mode from the <a href="http://www.imagesurfer.org">ImageSurfer</a> 
  program can generate such movies, as can <a href="http://www.paraview.org">ParaView</a> 
  and other programs.</p>
<p>The movie can spin either to the left or to the right. The program starts expecting 
  movies where the object spins to the left, but the <b><i>L</i></b> and <b><i>R</i></b> 
  keys can be used to switch direction as described below.</p>
<h2><img src="main_tcl.jpg" width="452" height="138" align="right">Using the program</h2>

<p>When the program is run and a file is selected, three windows will appear. 
  The control panel named <b><i>tk</i></b> that appears on the top when the program 
  is run (shown here to the right) has instructions for using the keyboard and 
  mouse to control the view, and a button to quit the program. The image window 
  that appears below it shows the frames as they are being loaded from the video 
  file and then a (by default) spinning stereo view of the file.</p>
<p><img src="quatload.jpg" width="183" height="81" align="right">While the frames 
  from the video are being loaded, the dialog box to the right will appear (and 
  each frame will be displayed as it is loaded). If you want to interrupt the 
  loading and quit the program, simply press the <b><i>Quit</i></b> button on 
  this dialog box. Once the entire video file has been loaded, this box will disappear.</p>
<p>If the program cannot display stereo on this computer, a warning dialog box 
  will appear to the right of the main <b><i>tk</i></b> window to let you know 
  that it is not available.</p>
<h3></h3>
<h3>Mouse Controls</h3>
<p>The left mouse button can be used to control the viewpoint. Press the button 
  and then move either left or right to spin the stereo view around the object. 
  If the view seems to move in the wrong direction and the stereo seems wrong, 
  use the <b><i>R</i></b> key to switch the direction of motion away from the 
  default.</p>
<p>The stereo window by default shows up at the same size as the original movie. 
  You can resize the window however you like, and the movie's size will be adjusted.</p>
<h2></h2>

<h3>Keyboard Commands</h3>

<p>The key commands for the program are only available when the 3D window has 
  focus; click on its title bar to enable them if focus is lost. The commands 
  are not case-sensitive, either shifted or unshifted characters will work. The 
  program recogizes the following commands:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>R</b>: Right-spinning movie. The default for the program is a left-spinning 
    movie. If stereo looks backwards and the mouse and keyboard commands are not 
    working in the right direction, use this to fix it.</li>
  <li><b>L</b>: Left-spinning movie, the default.</li>
  <li>&lt;: Spin the movie more towards the left. If it is spinning to the right, 
    it slows it down. If it is stopped, it starts it spinning to the left. if 
    it is spinning to the left, it spins faster.</li>
  <li>&gt;: Spin the movie more towards the right. If it is spinning to the left, 
    it slows it down. If it is stopped, it starts it spinning to the right. if 
    it is spinning to the right, it spins faster.</li>
  <li><b>space</b>: The spacebar stops motion.</li>
  <li><b>+</b>: Increase stereo disparity. This makes the separation between left- 
    and right-eye views larger, making the image pop out of the screen more. This 
    will also make it more difficult to fuse the images into a 3D percept. The 
    default is a single frame (the minimum).</li>
  <li><b>-</b>: Decrease stereo disparity. This makes the separation between left- 
    and right-eye views smaller, making the image pop out of the screen less. 
    This will also make it easier to fuse the images into a 3D percept. The default 
    is a single frame (the minimum).</li>
  <li><b>Q</b>: Quits the program.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version Information</h3>

<h3>Version 01.00:</h3>

<ul>
  <li> Original release version with basic funcionality. Ability to select left/right 
    spinning images, move through the video with the mouse, adjust the disparity, 
    and cause the movie to spin in either direction using keyboard shortcuts.</li>
  </ul>
