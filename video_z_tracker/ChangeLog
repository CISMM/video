	* TestGLCanvas.* : Added a HUD for the preview window to display 
		information (such as current stage Z height)
	* ztracker.* : Added calibration for OOF focusing, and OOF
		tracking algorithm for z tracking

	* Lots of code cleanup.
	* Supports now: XY tracking, Z tracking, Pulnix camera 
		(Roper code untested), MCL stage Z control

	* Stage simulation is generally working now, when video state is PAUSED.
	* zTracker.* : GUI updates for stage z position, zVelocity, and
		auto-tracking checkbox
	* zTracker.* : Added simple auto-tracking for uncalibrated case ...
		just climbs focus measure gradient (with some hysteresis)

	* Stage.* : Added to project.
	* zTracker.* : Moved video controls out of menu.  
	* Fixed frame offset bug when logging starting at frame != 0
	* Added toggle for drawing crosshairs
	* Added support for multiple arbitrary focus plot windows for
		easy comparison of focus measures (currently only SMD and
		scaled SMD) and weighting of pairs for the SMD (currently
		either uniform or tent).

	* PlotGLCanvas.* : Added to project.
	* PlotWindow.* : Added to project.
	* Got image stack loading working.  Currently video can be 
		played via the menu.  Not very convienant, but will do
		for the moment.  Also, added logging of focus measure 
		(currently SMD) and added a plot window to show the 
		curve of focus over time for the selected spot in the image.
