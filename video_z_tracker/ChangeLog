	* ztracker.cpp : Upped length of log filenames to 4096.
		Removed some old, commented-out code.

2009-07-27  Ryan Schubert  <res@cs.unc.edu>

	* Stage.cpp : Fixed comment typo.
	* TestGLCanvas.cpp : Removed some old, commented-out code.
	* ztracker.* : Upped length of log filenames from 80 to 256.
		Added MCLAccuracy() function to do a sweep of MCL range
		and then dump all position command/sensor pairs to a
		text file for analysis.

2009-03-26  Ryan Schubert  <res@cs.unc.edu>

	* TestGLCanvas.cpp : Fixed a race condition that caused a
		crash if we got a region changed event before we were
		ready for them.
	* ztracker.* : Added controls for all bead-specific calibration
		numbers (target, um/focus).  Now always displays the 
		current focus measure for the tracked position.  Added
		a vrpn server over which to send live bead position data.

2009-03-07  Ryan Schubert  <res@cs.unc.edu>

	* TestGLCanvas.* : Changed spot selection cursor to a round
		one that doesn't block the spot of interest.  Added the
		ability to toggle the HUD text and selection cursor
		color between black and white (for brightfield vs
		fluorescence).
	* ztracker.* : Same, plus currently has video logging line
		commented out (for testing stage logging).

2008-10-14  Ryan Schubert  <res@cs.unc.edu>

	* ztracker.* : Added microns per focus GUI text box (this is
		normally set during the bead calibration).  Added
		"keep bead centered" tracking mode (and a GUI text box
		for microns per pixel).

2008-09-15  Ryan Schubert  <res@cs.unc.edu>

	* ztracker.cpp : Made some changes to stage logging.  Now this
		app will automatically try to make a second connection to
		the same server as the stage server, with the device name
		"[stage device]Logger".  It's up to the stage server to
		also run an aux logger of that name that points at the 
		stage server.

2008-08-25  Ryan Schubert  <res@cs.unc.edu>

	* ztracker.cpp : Removed File...->Open from menu system.  Renamed
		"logging" in Advanced menu to "plotting".  Added a label
		for the p-gain text box.
	* ztrackmain.cpp : Fixed video server defaulting to 
		TestImage@localhost

2008-08-13  Ryan Schubert  <res@cs.unc.edu>

	* video_z_tracker.vcproj : Adding cameraImage class files.
	* cameraImage.* : Minor changes.
	* TestGLCanvas.* : Adding cmd-line specification of video server.
	* ztracker.* : same
	* ztrackmain.cpp : same

2008-06-04  Ryan Schubert  <res@cs.unc.edu>

	* PixelLine.cpp : Removed SMD modification that scaled by the
		inverse of the pixel intensities in preperation for doing
		fluroescence experiments.
	* Stage.cpp : Added handling for empty stage server; added
		offset calculations for X and Y.
	* TestGLCanvas.* : Added initial support for image gain;
		added logging toggle and logging indicator.
	* ztracker.* : Added z tracking damping for a stability/speed
		tradeoff if desired; removed camera GUI menu; made changes
		to stage logging code.
	* ztrackmain.cpp : Removed default stage name.

2008-03-19  Ryan Schubert  <res@cs.unc.edu>

	* Stage.* : Updated offset calculation to X, Y, and Z offsets
	* TestGLCanvas.* : Moved mousewheel event into its own function
		for doing mousewheel focus control of MCL.
	* ztracker.* : Updated app icon; added mousewheel focus control;
		added stage logging; some other GUI updates
	* ztrackmain.cpp : Changed default MCL server name
	* cameraImage.* : Added these files to CVS.  This class is an
		image wrapper that allows the vrpn video server and
		spot tracker lib to work nicely with each other.

2008-02-21  Ryan Schubert  <res@cs.unc.edu>

	* Stage.* : Enabled XY movement capabilities for stage
	* TestGLCanvas.* : Switched to use video imager server;
		added middle-mouse-button MCL navigation (for XY);
		added support for video logging
	* ztracker.* : GUI updates for navigation, logging, removed
		old GUI components;
		added XY MCL offset calibration;

2008-01-14  Ryan Schubert  <res@cs.unc.edu>

	* PlotWindow.cpp : Fixed updating by using Refresh()
		instead of Update() on the PlotGLCanvas.
	* TestGLCanvas.* : Now uses a vrpn_Imager_Remote for handling
		all camera connections.  This requires a vrpn imager server
		be running (currently on the same machine).
	* ztracker.* : removed camera support

2007-11-15  Ryan Schubert  <res@cs.unc.edu>

	* TestGLCanvas.* : Added a HUD for the preview window to display 
		information (such as current stage Z height)
	* ztracker.* : Added calibration for OOF focusing, and OOF
		tracking algorithm for z tracking

2007-05-11  Ryan Schubert  <res@cs.unc.edu>

	* Lots of code cleanup.
	* Supports now: XY tracking, Z tracking, Pulnix camera 
		(Roper code untested), MCL stage Z control

2007-03-23  Ryan Schubert  <res@cs.unc.edu>

	* Stage simulation is generally working now, when video state is PAUSED.
	* zTracker.* : GUI updates for stage z position, zVelocity, and
		auto-tracking checkbox
	* zTracker.* : Added simple auto-tracking for uncalibrated case ...
		just climbs focus measure gradient (with some hysteresis)

2007-03-18  Ryan Schubert  <res@cs.unc.edu>

	* Stage.* : Added to project.
	* zTracker.* : Moved video controls out of menu.  
	* Fixed frame offset bug when logging starting at frame != 0
	* Added toggle for drawing crosshairs
	* Added support for multiple arbitrary focus plot windows for
		easy comparison of focus measures (currently only SMD and
		scaled SMD) and weighting of pairs for the SMD (currently
		either uniform or tent).

2007-03-05  Ryan Schubert  <res@cs.unc.edu>

	* PlotGLCanvas.* : Added to project.
	* PlotWindow.* : Added to project.
	* Got image stack loading working.  Currently video can be 
		played via the menu.  Not very convienant, but will do
		for the moment.  Also, added logging of focus measure 
		(currently SMD) and added a plot window to show the 
		curve of focus over time for the selected spot in the image.


2007-03-01  Ryan Schubert  <res@cs.unc.edu>

	* *.* Added all new source files for this project.
