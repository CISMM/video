	* PlotGLCanvas.* : Added to project.
	* PlotWindow.* : Added to project.
	* Got image stack loading working.  Currently video can be 
		played via the menu.  Not very convienant, but will do
		for the moment.  Also, added logging of focus measure 
		(currently SMD) and added a plot window to show the 
		curve of focus over time for the selected spot in the image.
