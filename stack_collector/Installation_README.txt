Notes:
	The CISMM Stack Collector program requires DirectX version 9.0a or later(www.microsoft.com/directx).  It requires the camera drivers for any attached Roper or SPOT camera to be installed.  It also requires the National Instruments (NiDAQ) drivers to be installed, even if you're not using them (this is a "feature" of linking with NiDAQ libraries).
	For the CISMM Stack Collector program to work correctly, you must also install the NSRG Runtime Environment version 01.11 or later, which is a large download that includes all of the DLLs and other files needed to run applications from the NSRG.  It installs itself in C:\NSRG\external\pc_win32.
	This program is supplied AS IS, without any express or implied warranty of effectiveness or usefulness for any purpose.
