<title>Video Spot Tracker v01.26</title>
<h1>Video Spot Tracker version 01.28a</h1>
<p><img src="GUI.jpg" width="161" height="767" align="right">The <i><b>Video Spot 
  Tracker</b></i> program is used to track the motion of one or more spots in 
  a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/directx">Microsoft DirectShow</a>-compatible 
  video file, from a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/directx">Microsoft DirectShow</a>-compatible 
  camera, from a <a href="http://roperscientific.com">Roper Scientific</a> camera, 
  or from a <a href="http://diaginc.com">DiagInc</a> SPOT camera. The program 
  currently runs only on Windows, but it uses the portable openGL library for 
  rendering and the portable Tcl/Tk for user interface control.</p>
<h2>Running the program</h2>
<p>The program is run by dragging a video file onto the desktop icon that was 
  created when the program was installed. It can also be run by selecting one 
  of the camera-specific shortcuts from <i><b>Start Menu/All Programs/NSRG/Video 
  Spot Tracker v01.28a</b></i>.</p>
<h2>Using the program</h2>
<p>When the program is run, four windows will appear. The image window that appears 
  to the lower right contains the first image within the video file or a continually-updating 
  image from a live camera feed. The control panel named <b><i>tk</i></b> that 
  appears on the left when the program is run (shown here to the right) contains 
  a number of interaction widgets that control the operation of the program. The 
  <b><i>kernel</i></b> control panel that appears above the image window (described 
  later) controls the type of tracking kernel being used. The <b><i>log</i></b> 
  control panel in the upper right is described later.</p>
<h3>Selecting the color plane to use</h3>
<p><img src="red_green_blue.jpg" width="156" height="60" align="left">If the video 
  file (or video camera) contains different data sets in the red, green, and blue 
  channels then you will need to select the one you want to view. By default, 
  the red channel (channel 0) is selected. To select a different channel, click 
  on the &quot;0&quot; beneath the <i><b>red_green_blue </b></i>slider and type 
  its number into the dialog box that appears. Enter 1 for green and 2 for blue. 
  The video window should change to display the selected channel.</p>
<h3>Selecting spots to track</h3>
<p>To select the first spot to track, click on its center with the left mouse 
  button. A red plus sign will appear at the location you have selected. If you 
  want to adjust its radius, you can hold the mouse button down after you have 
  clicked and pull the mouse away from the center; pretty soon, the radius of 
  the disk will track the distance you have pulled the mouse from the center. 
  You can also adjust the radius by clicking on the number beneath the <i><b>radius</b></i> 
  slider within the <b><i>kernel</i></b> control panel and entering it into the 
  dialog box that appears or by moving the <b><i>radius</i></b> slider.</p>
<p><img src="three_tracks.jpg" width="168" height="174" align="left">To select 
  more spots to track, click on the center of each new spot with the <i>right</i> 
  mouse button. The default radius of each new spot tracker will match the radius 
  of the spot that was active when it is created. When a new tracker is created, 
  all other trackers turn blue. Each tracked spot will be labeled with an index 
  that matches its index in the stored tracking file.</p>
<p>If you click with the left mouse button when there is more than one tracker, 
  the closest tracker is moved to the location you picked and it becomes the <b><i>active 
  tracker </i></b>(in red). The active tracker's position and radius are shown 
  in the user interface, and they can be edited by clicking on the number beneath 
  the relevant slider. By selecting different trackers using the left mouse button, 
  you can adjust the position and radius of each tracker one at a time.</p>
<p>If you prefer to not have the centers of the tracked objects obscured by the 
  tracking markers, select the <b><i>round_cursor</i></b> checkbox from the <b><i>tk</i></b> 
  control panel. This will replace the plus signs with a circle around the center 
  at twice the radius that the kernel is set to use.</p>
<h3>Selecting the type of tracker</h3>
<p><img src="kernel.jpg" width="569" height="99"></p>
<p>There are four types of tracking kernels available within the program. They 
  are controlled using interface widgets in the <b><i>kernel</i></b> control panel. 
  The overriding parameter for tracking is whether the spots are dark points in 
  a lighter background (the default) or lighter points in a dark background). 
  This is controlled using the <i><b>dark_spot</b></i> check box located at the 
  top of the user interface. You should set this for the type of spot you are 
  seeking.</p>
<p>For tracking spots that are even in intensity, or which have uneven intensities 
  within them but a defined circular edge, the interpolating disk tracker should 
  be used. This kernel is enabled when the <b><i>interpolate</i></b> checkbox 
  is checked and the <b><i>cone</i></b> check box is cleared (the default).</p>
<p>For tracking spots that are brighter in the center and drop off to dim (or 
  darkest in the center and ramp up to bright), the <b><i>cone</i></b> checkbox 
  should be checked. For cone tracking, the radius should be set about 1/3 larger 
  than the spots you want to track (giving the kernel a good sampling of the background 
  as well as the spot). The setting of the <b><i>interpolate</i></b> check box 
  does not matter if the <b><i>cone</i></b> box is checked (this tracker always 
  interpolates).</p>
<p>If the bead profile is changing over time, or if it does not fit well into 
  one of the above categories, then the <b><i>symmetric</i></b> tracker should 
  be chosen. This tracker operates by locating the minimum variance in concentric 
  rings around the bead center. It sums the variance in circles of radius 1, 2, 
  3, ... up to the radius setting and divides each circle's radius by its circumference 
  to provide even weights for each ring. The radius should be set to be at least 
  slighly larger than the bead that is to be tracked; setting it larger will not 
  harm tracking except to make the program run more slowly.</p>
<p><img src="rod3.jpg" width="152" height="164" align="right">The final type of 
  kernel is the rod3 kernel. This is actually a grouping of three subkernels, 
  each of which is one of the above types. These three kernels lie along the same 
  line and move as a unit; they seek to track bars in the image. When this kernel 
  box is selected, a new control panel will appear. This control panel is shown 
  to the right, and it enables control over the length (in pixels) and orientation 
  (in degrees) of the bar trackers. As with the radius and position controls described 
  above, these controls change to display and control the values of the active 
  tracker. The most successful bars may be made of cone kernels and be slightly 
  less than the actual length of the bar on the screen. The least useful are probably 
  the symmetric kernels. Note that if the bars flex, this tracker may not work 
  very well.</p>
<p>Once you have selected the type of tracker to use, and have selected spots 
  to track, check the <b><i>optimize</i></b> checkbox. When you do this, the trackers 
  should all move themselves to the centers of the spots they were started on. 
  You can continue to add trackers using the right mouse button after you have 
  checked the optimize button; they will try to follow the center of the spot 
  even as you adjust their radius.</p>
<h3>Faster display update</h3>
<p><img src="small_area.jpg" width="162" height="175" align="right">Once you have 
  created all of the trackers you want, you may check the <b><i>small_area</i></b> 
  checkbox. This will cause the program to limit its update to a small area of 
  pixels that surrounds the active trackers. This requires less processing and 
  makes the update rate faster when the video is played. For the Roper and SPOT 
  cameras, it also reduces the amount of data transmitted from the camera itself, 
  again increasing the frame rate. This area will update itself as the trackers 
  move, and it extends 4 radii past each tracker. This should enable the trackers 
  to continue to track spots that are moving away from the updated video area. 
  A green box shows up in the video window to indicate the area being updated.</p>
<p>You can also manually adjust the area that is updated using the <b><i>minX</i></b>, 
  <b><i>maxX</i></b>, <b><i>minY</i></b>, and <b><i>maxY</i></b> sliders located 
  at the bottom of the control panel. If you do this, you will want to un-check 
  the small_area setting.</p>
<p>To turn off the small area tracking, and to undo the selection of a manual 
  region, click the <b><i>full_area</i></b> checkbox once. It will reset the update 
  area to cover the whole image and will then turn itself back off.</p>
<h3>Reading positions of trackers</h3>
<p>You can check the position of each tracker in turn by clicking on them with 
  the left mouse button, which makes each in turn the active tracker that shows 
  its values in the <b><i>x</i></b>, <b><i>y</i></b>, <b><i>z</i></b>, and <b><i>radius</i></b> 
  sliders. Note that these sliders may show subpixel positions and radii. Initial 
  testing on simple slightly-noisy images indicated that the interpolating trackers 
  have position errors of about .12 pixels on average, with a maximum of about 
  0.33 pixels, when tracking a perfectly-round disk of radius 5.5 pixels. You 
  can control the minimum step size that the optimizer will use by adjusting the 
  <b><i>precision</i></b> slider within the <b><i>tk</i></b> control panel. Smaller 
  values make the program run more slowly but will result in the program attempting 
  to find the position with greater precision (this will not necessarily correspond 
  to greater accuracy, due to noise and possibly aliasing).</p>
<h3>Recording the tracker motion</h3>
<p><img src="log.jpg" width="123" height="80" align="right">You can record the 
  motion of the trackers by checking the <b><i>Logging</i></b> checkbox within 
  the <b><i>log</i></b> control panel (shown to the right). This will bring up 
  a dialog box that will let you select a filename. It will automatically add 
  the default extension &quot;.vrpn&quot; to the filename you create. (A second 
  file, with the extension &quot;.csv&quot; will also be created, though the program 
  does not mention it.) Once you have selected a file name, you check the <b><i>play_video</i></b> 
  checkbox to begin going through the video file, or you can use the <b><i>single_step_video</i></b> 
  repeatedly to step through a frame at a time. When you are finished with the 
  section of tracking that you are interested in, uncheck the Logging checkbox 
  to stop the logging. You can then go forward to another section, turn on logging, 
  and save a different file if you like.</p>
<p>Logging will not occur while the file is paused, or when the end of the video 
  has been reached (this also means that the positions of the trackers in the 
  last frame of video will not be stored). This is done so that you can place 
  the trackers back onto spots that have jumped too far between frames when single-stepping 
  through the video and still get an accurate record of where the spots went. 
  There will be one entry in the file per tracker for each frame of video stepped 
  through or played through. The time values associated with each record are the 
  wall-clock time at which the particular frame left the screen (when the next 
  frame appeared); this is probably not useful and so should be ignored. <b><i>Note</i></b>: 
  Some video files have a 30 frame/second playback but have three copies of the 
  same video frame to produce an overall update of 10 frames/second; this will 
  produce repeated location reports for each of the identical frames.</p>
<p>The motion of the trackers over time is stored into two log files. The first 
  is a <b><i>Comma-Separated Values</i></b> format with the extension .csv. This 
  text format can be viewed in a text editor or loaded by several spreadsheet 
  and analysis programs. The second log file is in the <b><i>Virtual-Reality Peripheral 
  Network</i></b> (<a href="http://www.vrpn.org">VRPN</a>) format. This format 
  can be converted into a Matlab data file using the <b><i>vrpnLogToMatlab</i></b> 
  program that should have been installed at the same time the <i><b>Video Spot 
  Tracker</b></i> program was. You convert the &quot;.vrpn&quot; file into a Matlab 
  file by dragging it onto a shortcut that points to the program (or by dragging 
  it onto the program itself). The vrpnLogToMatlab program will have been installed 
  in the directory: <b><i>C:\Program Files\NSRG\Video Spot Tracker v01.26\VrpnLogToMatlib</i></b> 
  and it will also be located on the desktop.</p>
<h3>Controlling playback</h3>
<p>Whether logging is turned on or not, the video can be played by checking the 
  <b><i>play_video</i></b> checkbox, and paused by unchecking it. The <b><i>single_step_video</i></b> 
  checkbox will step forwards one video frame each time it is pressed. The <b><i>rewind</i></b> 
  checkbox causes the video to rewind to the beginning, play the first frame of 
  the video, and then pause.</p>
<h3>Kymograph function</h3>
<p>Clicking on the <i><b>kymograph</b></i> button in the main control panel brings 
  up two more windows and modifies the behavior of the first four tracked spots 
  in the image. This function is aimed at the study of cellular mitosis, and it 
  provides a &quot;spingle-centered&quot; trace through the image. The two centromeres 
  define the ends of the spindle. The point halfway between the two centromeres 
  is defined as the spindle center, which moves from frame to frame. The line 
  through the two centromeres is defined as the spindle axis, which rotates from 
  frame to frame.</p>
<p><img src="kymo_main.jpg" width="680" height="546"></p>
<p>When kymograph mode is enabled, the third and fourth points (the ones that 
  would normally be labeled &quot;2&quot; and &quot;3&quot;) are relabeled &quot;P&quot; 
  and &quot;A&quot; for posterior and anterior. These two points are not optimized 
  each frame no matter what setting the kernel optimization checkbox has, as they 
  are used to label the ends of the cell. A green line bisects the image halfway 
  between these points, indicating the 0 value on the cell-centered axis. Negative 
  values (to the left on the kymograph_center chart) are towards the posterior 
  end; positive towards the anterior. The white line down the center indicates 
  the cell center; dim lines indicate 10-pixel steps, and brighter lines indicate 
  100-pixel steps away from the center.</p>
<h2></h2>
<p><img src="kymo_trace.jpg" width="349" height="130" align="right">The first 
  window is named <b><i>kymograph</i></b> and it will accumulate traces from the 
  image through the first two tracked points (the points labeled &quot;0&quot; 
  and &quot;1&quot;). If there are not at least two tracked points, nothing is 
  shown in this window. As the video is stepped through or played, a new line 
  will be added to the window that is a resampling of the image pixels. The center 
  of this window on each line corresponds to the spindle center and the sampling 
  is done along the spindle axis. A green line is drawn between points 0 and 1 
  to indicate the spindle axis, and a green cross-line indicates the spindle center.</p>
<p><img src="kymo_graph.jpg" width="268" height="126" align="right">The second 
  window is named <b><i>kymograph_center</i></b>, and it shows how the spindle 
  center moves within the cell. If there are not at least four tracked points, 
  nothing is shown in this window.</p>
