Note:
	For the Airy Disk Creator to work correctly, you must also install the NSRG Runtime Environment, which is a large download that includes all of the DLLs and other files needed to run applications from the NSRG.  It installs itself in C:\NSRG\external\pc_win32.
	This program uses the GPL-licensed STOCC random-number library to generate the noise found in the image.  Thus, Airy Disk Creator is also released under the GPL.
